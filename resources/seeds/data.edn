  "<p>THIS COURSE WILL BE GIVEN FOR THE FIRST TIME IN ACADEMIC YEAR 2020/21.</p><p>Sustainable energy is an example of a wicked problem: it links to international markets, environmental externalities and social inequalities, comes with high economic costs, and concerns many stakeholders that have wide-ranging opinions. There is a clear urgency for transitions, but the wicked characteristics of sustainable energy transitions make it challenging to decide who should take action(s), which processes and instruments fit best and how to evaluate policy interventions. What is clear, is that the current debate requires well-informed integrated economic and governance insights.<br/>In this course students capitalize on what they have learned in the first two years of the BEB programme and apply this knowledge, methods and skills to energy transitions in the Netherlands and abroad.<br/>The course will focus on questions such as:<br/>- <span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt;color: #3a3e3f;\">how to understand energy transitions in the context of international political and economic developments?;<br/></span><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt;color: #3a3e3f;\">- how to understand energy transitions in the context of international political and economic developments?;<br/></span><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt;color: #3a3e3f;\">- what are the most important global, national and local policies and agreements (climate, energy, sustainability)?;<br/>- </span><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt;color: #3a3e3f;\">what is the role of technological and political lock-ins and how can we prevent that today’s solutions result in tomorrow’s problems?;<br/></span><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt;color: #3a3e3f;\">- why are new sources of energy contested and how to deal with these controversies?;<br/></span><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt;color: #3a3e3f;\">- how to govern the energy transition, also taking into account other transitions (circular economy, climate, biobased)?;<br/></span><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt;color: #3a3e3f;\">- </span><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt;color: #3a3e3f;\">what is the social, spatial and temporal distribution of costs and benefits of current and proposed policy interventions?;<br/></span><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt;color: #3a3e3f;\">- </span><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt;color: #3a3e3f;\">trough which instruments (such as taxes, regulations, nudging) can we incentivize a decrease in energy use by households and firms?;<br/></span><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt;color: #3a3e3f;\">- </span><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt;color: #3a3e3f;\">what is the potential of self-organizing initiatives such as local energy cooperatives of energy neutral neighbourhoods?.</span></p><p><br/><br/></p>",

  "<p>This course contributes to a further deepening of students' understanding of problems related to the use, management, and governance of natural resources. Taking a socio-legal perspective with a focus on property rights, access and resistance and social movements, the course explores the role of law and legal complexity in resource management and governance. Another important focus concerns processes of contestation of rules, institutions and resource-related (development or economic) policies in dynamic political and ecological contexts, as well as social mobilisation, violence and gender in natural resource-related conflicts. Climate change, wars and resource-related conflicts increase insecurity and vulnerability, and are therefore a major threat to the (food) security of the rural populations that crucially depend on natural resources for their livelihoods. The course deepens the students critical understanding of the relationships between legal-institutional complexity, practices of governing people and resources, and conflicts.</p>",

  "<p>This course aims to introduce students to key debates in the social sciences around the topics of modernity and social exclusion. These debates illustrate well how sociologists may choose between different theoretical perspectives, ethical viewpoints and strategies of intervention. The course also aims to give students a view of the various roles social scientists may be asked to play as a practitioner.<br/>Zygmunt Bauman, one of the foremost sociologists of our times has developed an important theory for understanding the sources and consequences of exclusion as a modern and global phenomenon. Each of the participating lecturers will complement Bauman's theory with his or her expertise in the field of development. Central to the course is the concept of 'wasted lives': the 'superfluous' populations of poor and unemployed people, migrants, refugees and other outcasts. 'Wasted lives', as Bauman puts it, are the inevitable outcome of modernization and the unavoidable side-effects of economic progress and the quest for order which is characteristic of modernity. <br/>During the first week the course offers a number of contrasting cases of 'wasted modernity' (social exclusion through bureaucratic governance; exclusion and inclusion in global food systems; the exclusionary effects of policy interventions aimed at confronting conflicts, natural disasters and economic breakdown; the emergence of shanty-towns and the depiction of rural migrants as a 'problematic category' in the city). In the second week Bauman's critique of modernity and modernization as outlined in his book 'wasted lives' is discussed in detail. In the third week, each lecturer contrasts Bauman’s position with other authors and different theoretical perspectives.</p>",

  "<p>Mathematical models are crucial in many scientific fields. Modelling that starts from first principles can then be a good start. For operational use in real practice, however, the model should be in good accordance with experimental data.<br/>The aim of this course is to introduce methods for the determination or identification of static/dynamic models starting from potentially limited to full prior system's knowledge, given experimental data and model objective, and to estimate the unknown parameters. In practice, the main model objectives are prediction, experiment design and management/control. In the first part of the course data-driven methods, in time and frequency domain, will also receive ample attention.<br/>The main application fields are the agro/biotechnology, environmental sciences and food science. In particular, attention will be paid to parameter estimation and network identification within systems biology using the Systems Biology (SB) Toolbox for Matlab.<br/>In the accompanying practical course the System Identification Toolbox will be used for the identification of a laboratory-scale process. <br/></p>",

  "Crop experiments are a fundamental part of research aimed at sustainable increases in food production, and many crop science professionals are involved either in conducting crop experiments or interpreting their results. The course teaches the theory and skills involved in crop experimentation. Emphasis is on acquiring advanced research skills in designing, conducting and analysing crop experiments within a coherent research framework, always coupling experimental design and methods to statistical theory and publication of the results. The course builds on knowledge and skills in statistics and reporting obtained in the BSc phase.<br/>The theoretical underpinning of the methodology of crop experimentation is described in a syllabus. Theory covers the most common statistical designs and methods used in crop experiments (including 3-factor experiments and split-plot experiments with contrasts); the methodology of field experiments and experiments under controlled conditions, experiments in containers, observations and sampling considering sources of variation and errors; and scientific reporting.<br/>Actual practices are illustrated using experiments, an excursion around research facilities, scientific papers, instructions, and seminars on on-going PhD research. Skills are trained in work sessions, practicals, self-study, and by providing feedback on deliveries. Topics of training include experimental design and set-up, sampling and observation techniques, data evaluation, statistical analysis of crop experiment data, drawing conclusions from this analysis, and high-quality presentation of research results. At the end of the course knowledge and skills of students is assessed through different tests and by writing a research report that is simplified version of an MSc thesis, thus making students familiar with requirements associated with such a thesis.<br/>At the end of the course the students will have insight in the methodology of crop experimentation and are able to use this knowledge to design adequate research methods and experiments. They understand the effects of the choices made during designing on the value of the data obtained and the conclusions that can be drawn.<br/>They are able to discern the individual steps in a research process; can apply proper practices in conducting experiments and taking observations; are able to manage, evaluate, and statistically analyse experimental data and present, interpret and describe the results; and compile the description of the individual research steps and outcome in a coherent report, using conventions as for scientific journals.",

What moves people to fight their neighbours, city members or acquaintances in the name of ‘ethnicity’?

Nevertheless, in times of conflict, constructions like the nation, the ethnic group, or any other putative identity can crystallize as a powerful, compelling reality.\nThis course introduces students to a selection of analytical approaches that explore the connection between identity and violence through an emphasis on social, spatial and virtual processes of boundary making and unmaking. The course examines the role of violent practices and violent imaginaries in the cementing of antagonistic identities, and the connections to elite machinations and predatory mythologies. It introduces students to social constructivism, spatiality and critical discourse analysis, and concepts such as identity, ethnicity, reification,urbicide and ‘everywhere war’. In the last part of the course, we address the rise of virtual boundaries and digital borders, and the ways remote technologies such as geospatial intelligence and drones have impacted contemporary war and warfare.",

  "<p>“Now more than ever, biology has the potential to contribute practical solutions to many of the major challenges confronting the . . . world. [The National Research Council] recommends that a ‘New Biology’ approach—one that depends on greater integration within biology, and closer collaboration with physical, computational, and earth scientists, mathematicians and engineers—be used to find solutions to four key societal needs: sustainable food production, ecosystem restoration, optimized biofuel production, and improvement in human health.”<br/><br/>This quotation from the report ‘A new biology for the 21st century’ of the USA National Research Council (2009) puts quite a responsibility on the shoulders of future biologists. The<br/>Wageningen Biology programme realises this responsibility by stating the following in its 2015 critical reflection.<br/><br/>“Understanding the complexity of biological systems, at scales ranging from single molecules to whole ecosystems, provides a unique intellectual challenge. The biosciences aim to understand living systems and preserve biodiversity and our environment, whilst simultaneously enabling us to produce sufficient, healthy, and safe food. The BSc Biology programme focuses on the functioning and complexity of living systems and the interactions with their (a-)biotic environment.”<br/><br/>Biological systems are arguably the most complex systems science tries to understand. We make observations, and try to obtain useful insight in the system. This requires hypotheses;<br/>ideas of how we believe the world around us is structured and operates. Models translate our hypotheses into concrete predictions about our objects of study that can be tested by targeted<br/>experiments.<br/><br/>The more complex the systems we study, the more crucial the use of models. There is a key role for one of the strongest tools in our scientific toolkit: mathematics. Mathematics are able<br/>to capture complexity in a form that makes it manageable. Mathematical models allow a full exploration of the consequences of our hypotheses and provide quantitative, and therefore<br/>precisely testable, predictions. Nowadays, this modelling toolkit is vastly extended by the wide availability of computers, which allow us to implement and test mathematical models, or even<br/>directly simulate the behaviour of complex systems. <br/><br/>In this course we attempt to convey the fascination for biological systems and introduce the tools to model them.</p>",

How can we move forward with research and action on these issues, while taking into account different disciplines and stakeholder perspectives, and political dynamics?<br/>Working on trans-disciplinary societal issues is core to the MSc program Communication, Health and Life Sciences. Students therefore need to learn about existing paradigms and strategies for change that have significance for these type of issues.

Typical for these new types of data is that they occur in large volumes, are high dimensional and occur at various levels in a hierarchy of data types.<br/>In nutrition and health sciences the effects of diet and lifestyle variables can be investigated with respect to physical and mental indicators of performance and well-being, and disease and mortality outcomes. In both the exposures (e.g. dietary intake: what, where, when?; physical activity what, where, when) and outcomes (e.g. dimensions of health) these high dimensional data occur. Moreover, data are continuously and automatically gathered that help to predict the exposures (e.g., through GIS, sensing, smartphones, social media). Data science is a new science that combines elements of statistics, mathematics, computer science and substantive knowledge.  Data science can be used to generate and investigate relevant research questions on causes and consequences of diet and lifestyle variables. In this course students learn about the opportunities and challenges for Big data in health research.<br/><br/>In this course the focus will be on data in the field of nutrition and health and health and society.<br/><br/>Course topics (as this course is currently under development, topics may be included or replaced according to recent developments in the field):<br/><span id=\"selectionBoundary_1549371744671_851645420669616\" class=\"rangySelectionBoundary\">&#65279;</span>-    Scripting and data analysis for a selected number of cases within this domain<br/>-    Critical reflection on the interpretation of analysis outcomes<br/></p>",

  "Development initiatives (policies, programmes, projects) and other interventions that aim to change society depend implicitly or explicitly on normative framings of problems, and on legal and institutional instruments to solve them. The use, management and governance of natural resources like land and water are often based on sets of principles, norms and rules that derive from a variety of legal and political forces between the local and the global. Resource management and governance strategies entail the introduction of new uses and valuations of resources, new technologies and forms of knowledge and expertise, and new principles, rules and laws to regulate these uses. The positive effects of instruments of control and regulation tend to be uncritically assumed rather than subjected to critical analysis. Often, however, natural resource policies and interventions get stuck between the ambitions of design and control on the one hand, and the 'real-life' perceptions, norms, choices, power relations, and practices of resource users on the other.\r<br/>This course introduces a socio-legal perspective on natural resources management and governance in a legally complex world. Linking legal-anthropological approaches to law and property rights to a selection of important social-scientific perspectives, concepts and theories, the course increases the capacity of students to critically reflect on the socio-legal and socio-cultural aspects of policies, interventions and design approaches in natural resource management. It teaches students to put into perspective normative and instrumental approaches by relating them to the socially, legally and otherwise complex settings of intervention where they take place. It sensitizes students to important values that may inform resource use, management and governance practices: from efficiency, productivity and control to legitimacy, equity, social and legal security, justice, and autonomy. Finally, it teaches students what kind of questions to ask in research or intervention or design processes.",

  "Nowadays, the workplace that employees occupy is more than just the functional physical place where work is performed within organisations. We see changing workstyles, from hierarchical structure and linear processes of the 20th century to highly connected, multi layered responsibilities, and self-directed cross functional teams. Also, the experience economy leaves its traces in the facility management (FM) domain, meaning the challenge to create memorable experiences at the workplace to inspire and keep employees engaged and happy. Moreover, there is abundant scientific evidence of different aspects of workplace design influencing the user’s emotional and physical condition and consequently their performance. That work environment is increasingly anytime and anywhere people want to meet and work. These, and other developments, impact contemporary workplace design and drive the need for FM to come with innovative workplace solutions. <br/>The purpose of this course is to apply various approaches to FM innovation to create work environments that meet users’ needs and organisational goals. The course sets out with a historical overview of FM and nowadays developments. Then we explore customer experience design, following the customer journey as a means to innovate and create new workplace experiences. We follow up on this by discussing the what, why (i.e. drivers and barriers) and how of innovation in FM, and exploring the concept of participatory design. The course continues with topics like personas and living lab that bring specific approaches to create new workplace experiences. We end up unfolding technology driven innovations in FM.",

  "<p>Note: This course can not be combined in an individual programme with PBR-31803 Genetics.<br/></p><p>This advanced course explains the most important genetic concepts to unravel and understand complex biological phenomena. We in detail explain the genetic processes underlying variation and its inheritance and their relevance with respect to evolution. We center our course around three main themes: Mutation, recombination and (epi-)genetic transmission. All three themes are both cause and consequence of evolution.<br/>We expect students to gain a thorough understanding of the concept of a separation between soma and germline and its genetic and evolutionary consequences: Cells in the soma differentiate and change phenotypically because of epigenetic but also genetic processes like for example polyploidization, mitotic recombination and cytoplasmic segregation. Similar processes affect the germline through meiotic recombination, mutation, segregation, ploidy changes and epigenetics. We expect students to integrate this knowledge into a larger understanding of how such mechanisms affect selection (that act on the soma as well as on gametes) and trade-offs in reproduction strategies. Mutations that favor the germline might adversely affect the soma and vice versa. Antagonistic pleiotropy, mutation accumulation are important concepts in this respect.  <br/>We illustrate these fundamental concepts in a series of both classical and state-of-the-art experiments, using a wide variety of model- (and well-studied) organisms like Arabidopsis, Aspergillus, Drosophila, Human and E. coli. In addition we discuss a number of classical research papers (like Mendels' original paper) and current research highlights in contemporary reviews (on topics like mutation, recombination and genetic transmission).</p>",

  "Biobased Logistics (BBL) is a disciplinary course in the field of Operations Research and Management. The course aims to provide a good understanding of the biobased supply chain focusing on decision problems related to the logistical structure of the chain as a whole. The students are trained to recognize problems, conceptualize solutions and develop quantitative models to support decision making in the biobased supply chain.\r<br/>The main managerial topics which are discussed are: \r<br/>- network design and geographical allocation of processing steps: we discuss decisions related to where to produce, how to transport and where to process main biobased products and byproducts to maintain a sustainable production; \r<br/>- assessment of sustainability: techniques and indicators that have been used to quantify the sustainability performance of the chain as a whole taking into account all three dimensions of sustainability (i.e. planet, people, profit) are discussed; \r<br/>- closing loops in the biobased supply chain: possibilities and ways to close nutrient cycles and minimize inflows to the chain are explored. \r<br/>The largest part of the course focuses on training students on Mixed Integer Linear Programming techniques that are used to solve problems in the biobased supply chain. We start by providing an overview of existing methods used in Operations Research to optimize decision-making in supply chains. MILP techniques that are useful to address questions of the biobased supply chain are introduced with lectures and small scale exercises adapted to the biobased supply chain context. We use computer practicals throughout the course to apply acquired knowledge and solve real life problems in the bio-refining sugar supply chain. The students have the opportunity to work intensively with cutting edge optimization software that is commonly used in the field of Operations Research.",

Informatie: https://tcs.sites.uu.nl/ \nLet op: de hoorcolleges van deze cursus worden in het Engels verzorgd. \nWe beleven momenteel een communicatierevolutie: de verspreiding van het internet en de snelle groei van online communicatie in de afgelopen decennia heeft onmiskenbaar onze samenleving veranderd, maar het is nog niet duidelijk waar dit proces heen gaat en welke gevolgen het heeft voor de westerse cultuur. In deze cursus plaatsen we dit proces in een historische context door het te vergelijken met de opkomst van andere massamediatechnologieën en hoe zij onze moderne wereld vorm hebben gegeven. Door deze vergelijking leer je de gevolgen van de opkomst van het internet voor de moderne cultuur beter te begrijpen en te voorspellen. In deze cursus beschouwen we massamedia als culturele verschijnselen: boeken, kranten, de telegraaf, televisie of internet zijn niet alleen technologieën, maar omvatten ook historisch specifieke praktijken en kennis. Er zijn veel voorbeelden hoe verschillende massamedia de moderne cultuur en samenleving vormden: de uitvinding van de drukpers hielp de ideeën van de Reformatie verspreiden over Europa, de snelheid waarmee de eerste trans-Atlantische telegraafkabel die tot communicatie tussen Noord-Amerika en Europa werd gebracht, de veranderde ideeën van ruimte en tijd, en de verspreiding van tv had ingrijpende gevolgen voor de manier waarop we geschiedenis schrijven. De massamedia hebben echter niet alleen geholpen bij het verspreiden van de beelden, ideeën, concepten en waarden die de moderne cultuur vormen (zoals rationalisme, nationalisme en het idee van vooruitgang), maar zij zijn zelf belangrijke symbolen van de moderniteit: de drukpers van Gutenberg en de telegraaf, bijvoorbeeld, werden ooit gezien als moderne wonderen - net als de iPhone, toen deze in 2007 werd geïntroduceerd. In deze cursus kijken we kritisch naar de culturele impact van deze massamedia-technologieën en de manier waarop ze in de moderne geschiedenis zijn vertegenwoordigd.",

  "In Nutrient Dynamics, knowledge of digestion and metabolism of nutrients in farm and companion animals will be extended and quantified. Students will read and discuss scientific papers on five various topics, such as microbial metabolism, growth in ruminants and nutrient based feed evaluation systems. Quantitative understanding of these topics will be obtained by application of extant mathematical models and developing new models. These models are mechanistic, i.e., based on understanding of the underlying processes involved.

  "This course offers an introduction to the interrelationships between forest, nature and society. On the one hand, forest and nature have multiple values and functions for society, while on the other hand society obviously has large impacts on forest and nature. Functions include ecosystem services, and societal impacts range from deforestation to nature conservation. The course offers a comprehensive framework to understand these interrelationships, taking several sectors of society (state, market and civil society), different actor groups (policy makers, NGOs, companies, citizens) and various nature values and functions (ecological, social and economic) as a starting point. Topics include: forest history in the Netherlands; international and Dutch forest and nature conservation policies and governance; the forestry sector; public participation; and different approaches in forest and nature management.",

  "Social scientists are often interested in relationships between different variables, e.g. consumption and prices. The objective of econometrics is to quantify such relationships using available data and statistical techniques and to interpret and use the resulting outcomes. So, econometrics is the interaction between (economic) theory, data and statistical methods (e.g. estimation and testing). The interaction of these three elements makes econometrics interesting and a must for the dedicated social scientist. The use of econometric tools stretches from economic and business disciplines to social science fields like sociology and history. \r<br/>The course helps to understand a number of econometric issues and techniques, where emphasis is on applying econometrics to research questions in the broad field of social sciences.",

Particularly during times of conflict, artists speak with a political voice and politicians, leaders and activists use art, and particularly visual culture, as a means of engaging with a larger population. Art functions as a symbol of the nation, a medium of propaganda and a forum for social and political critique.\n \nIn this course we will focus on art and politics in moments of crisis and situations of political and social conflict: war, revolution, repression, civil war and state terror. We will take a closer look at the visual arts during the First World War, the Third Reich and the Cold War, but also investigate traumatic encounters and more subtle entanglements of art and power during colonialism and the new imperialism of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. \n \nWe will touch upon themes such as historians and the ‘visual turn’, art and power, the politics of display, the individual artist and the collective, and the convergence and divergence of art and politics. The course uses forms of ‘high art’, for example paintings, architecture and exhibitions, but also includes a wider sense of visual culture, such as posters, press photographs and monuments. It starts from the premise that art cannot be understood without a solid understanding of its political, economic, social and cultural historical context.",

During the course, students acquire research skills that are necessary for the independent conduct of research. The combination of methodological review, practical exercises and feedback enables critical reflection on the potential effects and limitations of various approaches to data collection and analysis, and on the relationship between theoretical perspectives, research problems and methodological choices. Specific attention is paid to 1. choosing research approaches and designs, based on the underlying research premises and the research question at hand; 2. applying various methods, techniques and tools for data collection; and 3. using subsequent procedures for data analysis and processing. Within these three skill areas the following methods will be actively taught: survey questionnaires, experiments, interviews, focus groups, observation, visual methods, and digital methods related to social media. Therefore, this course provides a mix of traditional and innovative methods, techniques and tools, applied in interdisciplinary communication research.

  "Modern society faces many problems in relation to health and nutrition: malnutrition, overweight, alcohol abuse, food poisoning, etc. Food and nutrition science can have a great impact on public health, but it is not obvious that scientific progress simply results in better health for all. Just focusing on information and education often will not do. This leads to ethical dilemmas for food and nutrition scientists, professionals, and policy makers. We explore such questions  in this course. Are people fully responsible for their health or do governments and companies have responsibility as well? To what extent is it justified to limit people's food choices to promote health (e.g. in the types of foods, portion size, or ingredients) or to nudge persons to make better choices? What can we expect of food companies - should they promote health? Do we have a right to (healthy) food? Often in food policy a distinction is made between nutrition and health, and food safety - but is this distinction as clear as it seems? In this course we explore a variety of problems, and analyse the central concepts that we use to respond to such problems: paternalism, quality of life, justice, trust, responsibility, autonomy, safety, etc. Different ways of ethical thinking are presented and students learn to formulate questions and test ethical arguments. In this way, they reflect on their study area and develop skills to analyse and discuss ethical dilemmas in their future career, and be capable to justify difficult professional choices.",

The second objective is to convey a basic but current knowledge of atmospheric composition in terms of air pollution and greenhouse gas concentrations, and their effects, along with an appreciation for the research that led to this knowledge. This course gives students the knowledge and skills to understand today's most pressing issues in atmospheric chemistry and air quality. This includes the chain of processes that occur between emissions of pollutants from natural and anthropogenic sources, and their effect on ecosystems, human health, and the composition of the atmosphere. Special emphasis is on quantifying the effects of air pollution through acquisition and analysis of field measurements, and through numerical modelling of the processes involved (e.g., transport, chemistry, deposition, biogeochemical cycles). Sources, effects and possible abatement measures of local air pollution, acid deposition, eutrophication, ozone in troposphere and stratosphere (the Antarctic ozone hole) and climatic change are explained.",

  "The course Life History of Aquatic Organisms deals with the biology and ecology of aquatic organisms, with an emphasis on life history theory. The focus in the course lies with animal species, especially those which are important for fisheries, aquaculture and nature conservation. A wide array of subjects is treated, from the organism (reproduction, feeding, homeostasis, migration, habitat use), the population (population ecology) and the community level (fish communities), as well as a large variety of aquatic systems and diverse organism groups. To understand the life history of organisms, i.e. to comprehend why they are like they are and why they behave like they do, evolution is the leading principle. Evolutionary mechanisms can explain how organisms have adapted to certain environmental circumstances, but also that not all structures and behaviours are necessarily adaptive, or the best possible solution. From the perspective of the life history of organisms there are three concepts that are leading in this course: 1) adaptation, which is a phenotypic change in a species, caused by environmental pressures, leading towards better fitness; 2) constraint, which means that adaptations and patterns of traits in a species are restricted by the phylogeny (evolutionary history) of the species; and 3) trade-off, which is an (evolutionary) compromise in the structure, physiology, or behaviour of a species. Trade-offs occur when the development of several traits is coupled, prohibiting the independent optimization of all these traits.",

  "<p>This advanced course covers on the one hand the economic analysis of investments and policy changes (Cost-Benefit Analysis), on the other hand it treats the valuation of environmental effects of such projects or policies (Environmental Valuation). Investments are often in productive sectors, such as in land consolidation, polders, irrigation and drainage projects, or in infrastructure, for example roads and railways, or, less often, in nature conservation projects. Policy changes that can be appraised are, for example, taxes, price-support measures and market regulations. CBA is a decision-making tool for policy makers, using financial and economic criteria. Emphasis is put on the theory of cost-benefit analysis: welfare economic foundations, financial versus economic analysis, valuation of commodities, capital, labour and foreign exchange, discount rate, shadow pricing, effects on income distribution, and environmental effects. The last element is extensively treated under the headings travel cost methods, contingent valuation, hedonic pricing, existence value, and irreversibility, risks and uncertainty.<br/>This is an advanced course that builds on knowledge offered in introductory microeconomics or environmental economics courses such as ENR-21306, DEC-10306, or UEC-21806.

  "<p>Digestion of food is a complex process that is essential for our life. The process of digestion starts in the mouth and continues in the stomach, small and large intestines, and ends at the anus. On its way the food bolus is systematically broken down into smaller pieces and/or soluble components. This is done via a large number of complex mechanical, enzymatic and chemical processes. Mechanical transformations reduce the size of the food particles and mainly take place in the mouth and stomach. During enzymatic transformations, macromolecules (proteins, carbohydrates etc.) are hydrolysed into smaller components.&lt;<br/>In this course the interaction of food with the mouth and stomach is discussed. The focus is on the breakdown of the structured food matrix in the mouth by oral processing and further breakdown in the stomach. The influence of food structure on breakdown is discussed in relation to its effect on perception, satiety and satiation. The process of food digestion can be studied by in vivo experiments in humans and animals or by using in vitro models and in silico mathematical modelling. You will learn what information can be obtained from human and animal studies, including the technical difficulties and ethical limitations. Furthermore attention is paid to the large variety of in vitro models that are available nowadays, from simple in vitro models that are used to gain mechanistic insight in the digestion process to the complex in vitro systems that are mimicking the whole human digestive tract. In vitro models usually have to compromise between technological complexity and biological significance, so a critical attitude is required towards the information derived from such models. Currently mathematical models are not widely used yet, but they might give new insights in the digestion process and therefore provide new hypothesis for experimental research.The knowledge on digestion of food can be applied to design foods with desired properties and functionalities such as foods providing enhanced satiety (suitable for weight management), efficient energy release (useful for athletes), controlled glucose uptake (important for diabetics) or high uptake of proteins (relevant for elderly or chronically ill people).</p>",

  "Our understanding of molecular pathways that govern energy metabolism and immunology have evolved \r<br/>largely in parallel. However, current evidence points to a close interplay between immunological and \r<br/>metabolic processes. First, it has been established that obesity results in the activation of the innate \r<br/>and adaptive immune system and promotes the development of metabolic abnormalities, culminating in increased susceptibility to type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and cancer. Second, it is now clear \r<br/>that the behaviour of cells of our immune system including monocytes, macrophages and lymphocytes is \r<br/>largely determined by the status their intracellular energy metabolism. \r<br/>This course will provide an in depth coverage of the concept of immunometabolism. The course will \r<br/>specifically focus on the molecular mechanisms governing metabolism that underlie immune cell \r<br/>functioning including oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis. Metabolic and immune-related pathways intersect at numerous levels. Their common regulation is effectuated by several hormonal signaling routes that involve specific nuclear hormone receptors and adipokines including PPARs and leptin/adiponectin that will be discussed during the course.\r<br/>Finally, the concept of immunometabolism will be applied to various conditions ranging from our host response towards infection to the development of obesity and related complications.",

  "Analysis of components in food materials is important for research, as well as for quality control, and to trace the origin of food materials. In each of these applications, the major issue is to be sure that you actually analyse those and only those compounds on which you need information. Since food products typically have a very heterogeneous composition (different classes of components, but also variants of the same molecules) the identification and quantification of specific compounds is often not straightforward. In this course, the student will learn a range of techniques that is used for a range of components. The basics of these techniques will be explained, as well as the applications, and examples how these are used in industry (quality assurance / quality control), or in academic research.<br/>Examples are:<br/>- Field of application:<br/>Quality Control (choice  of method); Food Research and Development; Tracing and tracking (GMO); Authenticity; Allergens; Bio-functionality/ components; chemical food safety.<br/>- Techniques:<br/>Gross-compositional analysis: Near infra-red, Dumas, total sugar, total phenolics; MS, Chromatography, sample preparation;Fingerprinting: Proteomics (LC-MS); Isotope analysis, chemometrics, NMR; Immuno-assays; Chemical: LC-MS, sample preparation; Biological: Cell cultures, bio(chemical) assays.<br/>- Case/Example: <br/>Melamin / milk; Maillard; Soy; Parmasan-cheese; Extraction; Health claims/ EFSA pesticides, marine biotoxins, dioxins.<br/>To understand how these techniques are used, and how the results should be evaluated, the lectures will provide detailed information about the background and sensitivities of the different methods. In the laboratory classes, the students will work with the analysis of different types of specific compounds from extracts from food products.

What sort of linguistic phenomena are most amenable to logical treatments? How expressible should such logics be, and how can they be defined? How can logical treatments of natural language meaning help computers to understand it? What is the experimental support for semantic theory? \nThis course gives an intensive introduction to the study of these questions in contemporary theoretical, computational and experimental linguistics. We will start from basic notions in formal semantics: entailment, ambiguity, compositionality, direct model-theoretic interpretation, types and model structure, boolean operators and generalized quantifiers. Motivations and examples will draw on recent findings in experimental and computational semantics. A selection of diverse semantic problems involving plural expressions, presupposition, modification, lexical meaning and pragmatics will be discussed.\nPart of the course will cover on-going work on the computation of meaning for natural language.

  "Multicellular eukaryotes are in general formed from a fertilized egg and, by division and a differential use of the genetic information, a multicellular organism is formed composed of different cell types that are present in a specific pattern. One of the most important discoveries in biology is the observation that most animals, although they can have very different forms, share sets of genes that are key regulators of the body plan; the developmental toolkit. Within this toolkit 2 kinds of regulators are present: transcription factors and elements of signal transduction systems.\r<br/>The most detailed knowledge concerning this toolkit has been obtained from molecular genetic research on Drosophila. Therefore the molecular mechanisms controlling Drosophila development will be described first. Students will also have to build models of developmental pathways, using computer simulations as a tool. Subsequently, the insights obtained with this system about the developmental toolkit will be applied to other systems like mouse, human, xenopus and zebrafish.\r<br/>In addition to pattern formation during embryogenesis attention will be given to stem cells and their potential to form post-embryonically differentiated cells as well as the mechanisms by which cells loose their potency to differentiate into other cell types. This part of the lectures will be put in the context of medical applications involving the cloning of organisms and the in vitro formation of specialised cell types and organs.",

  "Spatial planning deals with the allocation and distribution of land and other spatial resources. Planners pursue this task by using governmental power, economic incentives, and communicative strategies. Thereby, public authority, trust and money are used. This activity raises many questions with respect to efficiency, effectiveness, justice, legitimacy, and many more. Therefore, it is important for spatial planners to reflect on their activity in a systematic and structured way. This course consists of two main elements: <br/>- The first element is a literature based structured reflection on different theoretical perspectives on planning to provide a basis for this reflection by focusing on different perspectives and their contradiction in planning. It entails dilemmas between and within concepts of effectiveness of planning (i.e. modes of governance, incrementalism vs. rational-comprehensive planning), efficiency (land economics and planning), democracy (participatory and collaborative planning), legitimacy (political theory of planning), balancing interests (pluralism in planning), responsibility (exclusion and inclusion and theory of goods). <br/>- The second element focuses on applying this knowledge to specific spatial situations. The element on 'justice in the city'. How does a just city look like? This simple question is multifaceted and has implications for urban geography and spatial planning. The reason for the complexity of this question is that there are different and competing concepts of justice. In this element of the course, the combination of abstract theories on concepts of justice with spatial planning practice is central.",

  "<p>Note: This course can not be combined in an individual programme with GRS-10806  Geoinformation Science for Planning and Design.<br/></p><p>The course introduces Geo-Information Science and its scientific and societal interests. The starting point of the introduction is the geo-information cycle. This cycle frames geo data based actions like acquisition and storage, processing and visualization. It is explained that these actions can be used to describe, to analyse, to design and to realize real world phenomena. Thus geo data is always acquired, processed and visualized with a specific purpose. This is illustrated via the conceptual, formal and technical modelling steps. <br/>Important in these modelling steps are the roles of geographical data attributes (thematic, geometric, temporal). Because the acquisition and processing of geo data is purposive, meta data plays an important role to find geo data and geo data processing steps. It also is important to evaluate the (re)usability of geo data and geo data processing steps. Meta data explain important geo data characteristics like (geo)reference, map projection and available attributes. Geo-visualization, especially cartography concepts, is introduced to show how geo data ought to be communicated. After the introduction of the geo data related concepts, the course offers the geo data processing options. The latter is done by the introduction of three data handling classes (query, transform and alter) and the data-action model. The geo data that represent terrain height and processing of these elevation data has given notice. Besides, basic concepts of Remote Sensing (spectral signature, sensor types, visual and quantitative processing) are also introduced. The application of all concepts is practiced during a practical and by a small project using professional software and data according a working procedure.</p>",

Then, various lectures will deal more specifically on how ecosystem services regulate and support soil biota as well as on non-soil functional species groups including insects or plants. To deepen the knowledge gained in these lectures, a field visit and fieldwork will be carried out through soil quality assessments and the identification of beneficial soil, insect or plant biota. The field experience will be linked to different lectures about agroecological cropping practices such as intercropping, cover cropping, conservation agriculture (no tillage and permanent cover), sustainable crop rotations and biological pest control. Students will understand the role of agroecological cropping practices and learn about state of the art materials and agroecological innovations.

  "To concern oneself with history is to concern oneself with writing. Clio, the muse of historiography, is usually depicted with a quill, papyrus scrolls and other tools for recording history. Even today, writing forms a central part of historians' working lives. Whether they work as researchers or in the culture, education, public or private sectors, writing and assessing texts and transferring knowledge remain crucial skills for historians when they leave university as well. In this course, you will practice transferring knowledge, insights and opinions using a variety of writing genres, such as a review, encyclopaedia entry or opinion piece. Thanks to the intensive supervision and feedback of your lecturers and fellow students, this course will give you a better insight into the transfer of historical knowledge through writing, improve your writing style and increase your pleasure in writing! You complete the course by writing and presenting a magazine together with a group of fellow students.\n \nYou will not be marked for this course. The weekly assignments and the feedback given by individual students will be assessed instead. Together, the weekly assignments and the magazine written as a group will form your student portfolio. Once you have completed all of the assignments – including rewriting assignments, giving feedback and writing the mutual end product – and assembled an individual portfolio, you will have passed the course. There are no resit opportunities and the assignment deadlines are definitive. If you miss a deadline, you will no longer be able to participate in the course.",

  "<p>Too- big- to- fail banks that are in danger of going bankrupt, thousands of migrants who try to cross the Mediterranean on shaky boats, food scandals and pathogen related diseases, vast trade agreements that are being negotiated and simultaneously face strong critiques; for many of today's most pressing crises and challenges, citizens, media, and even national politicians look at the European Union institutions for developing effective solutions. Others, on the contrary, blame the European project for being the main reason why these crises have emerged in the first place. In either case, the European Union has a major influence on setting legal frameworks, particularly also in the life sciences domains. The aim of this course is to make students familiar with the basic principles, legal structures and processes of governance at the EU- level. The course introduces students to the EU's history, its main institutions and legal frameworks, the policymaking process, and the political struggles that take place around a number of issues that are relevant to the life sciences domains.<br/>Although the course is primarily targeted at students of the MSc specialization Food Safety Law, it is accessible to and insightful for students from different backgrounds who are interested in the basic functioning of the EU and its main policies in the 'Wageningen domains'. The first half of the course provides a general background to the EU, including its history, main institutions, decision-making procedures, and implementation pathways. In the second half of the course we will discuss the development of a number of relevant policy domains, including the internal market, marine policy, environmental policy, agricultural policy, and food policy. At the end of the course, students will be able to explain the functioning of the EU's main institutions and policies, to use and analyze official EU documents and legislation, and to critically appraise an ongoing policy debate.<br/>Beside lectures, the course entails an excursion to Brussels, where we will visit some of the EU institutions and stakeholders. In addition, during the whole course students work on a group paper about an ongoing EU policy debate, such as the Common Agricultural Policy, GMOs, TTIP, marine spatial planning, or the supervision of banks. The course ends with an exam that tests the knowledge obtained.</p>",

  "<p>This advanced course in environmental plant and crop physiology aims to broaden and deepen the knowledge and skills of students interested in plant-environment interactions in controlled environments, such as are found in modern horticultural production systems and in research. This course is intended for students who plan to do their MSc-thesis research at the HPC-group, but might also be interesting for students interested in plant-environment interactions and plant phenotyping. The focus will be on understanding plant and crop behaviour via measurement, and analysing and modelling physical and physiological processes that significantly influence plant growth and performance in environments with a high degree of controllability (e.g. greenhouses, plant factories, growth environments for research). Special attention will be paid to photosynthesis, water status, and the role of irradiance, especially duration, periodicity, intensity and spectrum (eg comparing natural irradiance and artificial irradiance (eg from LEDs)), and the effects of extreme climates that might occur in these environments (e.g. high CO2-concentration, high humidity, 24h irradiance). Measuring and characterising light and other climate- and plant-variables (plant temperature) will be discussed in detail, as well as the measurement of photosynthesis, water relations and other relevant physiological processes. Students will do a small-scale project in which they will experience the acquisition, analysis and modelling, and the integration of data in conceptual frameworks related to ongoing research projects at HPP.</p>",

In addition to the biological, physical and chemical concepts introduced in the these courses, students will be assumed to have a basic knowledge of chemistry (especially physical chemistry), physics and mathematics. In particular students will be expected to be familiar with (but with a knowledge or understanding not limited to) the following concepts: <br/>They need to be capable of quantitative thinking and reasoning. <br/>They need to be familiar with basic algebra, including working with logs and exponentials, basic calculus (eg knowing that the first order derivative of y=a+bx+cx2 is b+2cx), the significance of graphs, and the use of symbols to represent factors and variables. <br/>In terms of physics, they need to understand the use and significance of scientific units (moles, meters, kilograms, Pascals etc), and be familiar with light (eg spectra, photons and energy, wavelength, absorption), the gas law (PV = nRT), absolute temperature, the conservation of energy, Ohm's law and the relationship between conductance and resistance,  the concept of change in physical systems, flow or flux, and have a basic understanding of electrons in atoms (an elementary understanding of quantisation and energy levels - no understanding is needed of quantum numbers etc). <br/>In relation to chemistry/physical chemistry they need to be familiar with chemical formulae and terminology, the basics of oxidation and reduction, chemical kinetics and rate constants, and simple physical chemical concepts such as pH, heat capacity, vapour pressure and humidity, concentration etc.<br/>It is also assumed that students taking this course will have basic statistical  knowledge, the most important of which are; t-test (independent samples or pairwise), F-test (Analysis of Variance), linear regression, experimental design (blocking). In Wageningen these topics are covered in Statistics 1+2 and Advanced Statistics courses.<br/>To write their project report students are expected to be able write well in English in terms of grammar, syntax and structured reasoning and argument. They should be able to write using normal scientific vocabulary and phrasing, and scientific units, species names, the names of chemicals etc should all be written according to the normal rules for scientific writing.  To illustrate their work and effectively present their data they should be able to make graphs and tables (including captions) of a standard comparable to that encountered in normal scientific writing (eg a scientific  paper). Students should also be able to include literature references in their text in a normal and consistent way (e.g. no initials used; 2 authors both mentioned, 3 or more only the 1st author and  et al. added), and to make a literature list with a consistent structure for the references cited (e.g. all journal names in full or abbreviated, words in the paper title do not all start with capitals etc).  An example of author instructions for the Journal of Experimental Botany can be found at https://academic.oup.com/jxb/pages/General_Instructions - sites like this provide useful guidance for scientific writing and illustration; and see also a recent paper from a journal, like Journal of Experimental Botany, which makes clearer the layout expected.</p>",

  "Big Data usually refers to data sets with sizes beyond the ability of commonly used software tools to capture, curate, manage, and process data within a tolerable elapsed time. With the advancements in computing, the realization of Big Data systems has now become feasible and can trigger innovation and growth for various application domains, including most Wageningen University and Research domains. <br/>This course will discuss both the key concepts of Big Data and provide hands-on-experience in developing and using Big Data systems. We introduce concepts related to Big Data system architectures, distributed filesystems, the Map-Reduce framework, Resilient Distributed Datasets, and scalable linear and machine learning models, and how they are made available with cutting-edge technologies such as the Hadoop Distributed File System and Apache Spark. Students will practice with tools with individual tutorials, and gain hands-on experience by working on a group project formed as a \"data challenge\". Students will demonstrate the use of the tools learned in the course, but also their creativity as data scientists, that includes communicating the value of their findings with visualization tools. The course has been designed in such a way that it is accessible for students of a diverse range of disciplines in Wageningen University, like geo-information science, environmental sciences, biosystems engineering, bioinformatics and social sciences.",

En welke morele praktijken (bijvoorbeeld m.b.t. rijkdom en armoede of ten aanzien van vreemdelingen) zijn voor het alledaagse leven van religieuze mensen belangrijk?

Daarbij wordt ingegaan op Jodendom, Christendom, Islam, Boeddhisme en Confucianisme, maar ook op inheemse, bijvoorbeeld Afrikaanse, tradities.\n- De tweede, toepassingsgerichte benadering analyseert hoe religies met concrete actuele morele problemen omgaan. Daarbij ligt de nadruk op de omgang van de mens met de niet-menselijke natuur: dieren, het milieu, en klimaatverandering, maar ook (heilige) plaatsen.

  "This course examines the chemical and biological quality of resources in the circular economy. Recovering and reusing waste streams is required to realize a truly circular, bio-based economy. However, these waste streams can contain contaminants that can hinder safe reuse. Thus, this course considers the resource quality aspects that must be considered when resources are reused in short cycles. Focus is placed on organic, nutrient, and water cycles, however other resources are considered in the course. <br/>The course first gives an introduction to the chemical and biological contaminants that may be present in waste streams. Chemical contaminants include emerging contaminants such as micropollutants, industrial contaminants, nutrients, and salts. Biological contamination focuses on pathogenic fecal bacteria and viruses, opportunistic pathogens, and antibiotic resistance. For both chemical and biological contaminants, students learn the sources of these pollutants, their accumulation or dissipation in different environmental technologies, and their fate in environmental systems and perform calculations. <br/>After an introduction to the contaminants, students learn about the risks associated with the contaminants. To this end, students receive lectures and perform tutorials to calculate the risks associated with biological and chemical contaminants in environmental systems and drinking water systems. These exercises provide a good understanding of methods to determine risks associated with contaminants in resource cycles. <br/>Finally, mitigation options are covered to give an understanding of the available methods to ensure resource quality. These cover environmental technologies to remove contaminants, policy instruments to control contaminant use and release, and monitoring tools that can be used to screen for resource quality and determine effects.",

Sustainability aspects, that is ecological, economic and social aspects, play an important role in the design process. The problems / cases in this course are more complex and on a higher systems level than in the course Engineering Design (FTE-24806). The design methods taught in FTE-24806 are extended with new ones.\r<br/>The structure of the course is based on Reflexive Interactive Design, with main steps 1) system and actor analysis and 2) structured design. Methods in systems engineering and in Theory of Inventive Problem Solving (TRIZ) like Technology Landscaping, Innovation Trend Analysis and resolving Design Contradictions are taught. The course includes an extensive state-of-the-art analysis (based on intellectual property (IP)-research, knowledge research, market exploration). Also the organisation of a design project gets attention.\r<br/> Some typical examples of technological innovations in biosystems are presented, discussed and studied. Students will spend most of the course time on applying the theory and the ideas behind it to their own design case.\r<br/>The case is meant to develop competence in contributing to design teams at the level of:\r<br/>- problem analysis (analysing the need and setting the design objective);\r<br/>- generating and evaluating stakeholder requirements and design constraints;\r<br/>- function and device analysis of hybrid systems or new systems;\r<br/>- IP-research (able to perform a state-of-the-art analysis for a design case);\r<br/>- generating working principles with functions and manage proven solutions;\r<br/>- proposing well-founded design concepts;\r<br/>- evaluating their compliance with the given requirements;\r<br/>- presenting and passing on design concepts through visual, oral and textual expression.",

  "The course starts with a general outline of food quality as an important topic for consumers, and therefore for the food industry, and the need to describe this quantitatively will be discussed. For a quantitative analysis, food quality needs to be decomposed in measurable and quantifiable food quality attributes. The course then continues with a general introduction to modelling, addressing how models work, what their opportunities and limitations are, what model  parameters are, and what the role of statistics is, namely to estimate model parameters and their uncertainties. This is followed by a lecture on thermodynamics of what drives reactions in foods, as a tool to predict whether or not reactions are possible in foods. If reactions are possible, the next question is whether they also take place at a measurable range. This is the domain of kinetics: how fast do such reactions occur. In between, many examples will be given taken from food science literature and students will actively do modelling on the computer using Excel. The principles are illustrated for chemical, biochemical, physical and microbiological reactions in foods. Applications are shown in shelf life modelling. Moreover, attention will be paid to modelling of reactions in reactors. The course will finish with a reflection on the possibilities and limitations of modelling food quality.",

This course can not be combined in an individual programme with CPT-39506 Public Health Practice<br/><br/>This course is one of the core-courses for future public health professionals aiming at a career in the public and private sector. In this course students learn how public health policy and interventions are developed. <br/>In society, health is an important asset as it is a resource for everyday living. It enables children to go to school and develop their potential, adults to work and care for their families and elderly to remain involved in society. Health is more than an individual matter; the functioning of our society depends on healthy people. Therefore, it is of great importance to optimize health and its related lifestyle factors (healthy diet, moderate alcohol consumption, non-smoking, physical activity etc.). Analysis of major health problems and their determinants is needed to develop public health policies and programmes that intend to result in considerable health gains in the long term.<br/>In this course methods will be introduced and explained which support the planning and implementation of public health policies and programmes. Relevant theories, concepts and tools will be presented, and illustrated with practical examples. For this purpose, the public health cycle will be introduced. This planning model provides a basic framework for professionals working in the field of public health that can be used for planning, implementing and evaluating policies and programmes. This planning model includes the following seven steps: conduct a needs assessment, support priority setting, formulate aims and objectives, construct a logic model, develop an evaluation plan, perform quality control, and analyse processes and outcomes.</p>",

Students are only allowed to start with their thesis writing after the successful completion of the Assessment part:<br/>a) The assessment assists students in developing a clear view on their personality, characteristics and potential. Using the outcomes of an aptitude test students start thinking about their career in an early stage of the academic program. This will strengthen their ability to make proper choices in study programs and focus from year 3 on. They will visit an alumnus working in their field of interest for a 'reality check'. Students discuss, based on acquired insights, a well explained study plan with the study advisor.<br/>b) The BSc thesis. The BSc thesis can be written under supervision of the staff of the chair groups: CPT, UEC, MCB, SCH or FQD.<br/>The student has to study (by means of a literature review or empirical research) a subject within the field of the major and prove to have sufficient knowledge to critically analyse and summarize the given subject. He/she must also be able to clearly communicate the findings in writing and by oral presentation. The subject will be determined in consultation with the thesis supervisor. The student has to define the research problem and formulate research questions in a proper way, deal with the logistics of carrying out such an individual research project, plan and schedule the different activities in a decent way, and present the results in writing in a clearly organized report.</p>",

  "People want to be in control. In Wageningen most systems to be controlled are non-linear. Examples are chemical reactors, batch bioreactors , mechanical systems such as robots, climate control systems, environmental systems, but also management systems. This course teaches you how to optimally control such systems based on a mathematical model of the system in state-space form and a criterion reflecting the control objectives. Since the model is hardly ever a perfect description of reality, measurements will be used to improve the information concerning the state of the system. Retrieving this information is performed by so called state observers. Therefore the design and properties of state observers is another important subject considered in this course. Algorithms needed for the implementation of an optimal control strategy will also be presented. The optimal controller designs and their software implementation in a real-time controller will be tested on a computer and on a laboratory set-up.",

  "This course provides critical insight into the political and econonomic processes that govern climate change. It consists of six topics:<br/>- the development of climate policy on a sub-national, national and international level, from a political and economic perspective;<br/>- the political dynamics emerging from a new international climate agreement;<br/>- the role of non-state actors in climate governance;<br/>- major theories and concepts relevant for the analysis of climate governance: regime theory, fragmentation and poly-centric governance; game theory; behavioral economics; discourse; the science-policy interface;<br/>- economic incentives and instruments for climate policy;<br/>- the governance of specific areas of climate policy, including sub-national and non-governmental initiatives (mitigation and adaptation policy).<br/><br/>By engaging with these six topics, the course centres on the trend in climate governance that is gradually moving from predominantly state-driven negotiations and hierarchical governance instruments to a type of climate governance characterised by diversity and fragmentation. The first type includes UNFCCC negotiations and instruments with a central role for the state, such as carbon tax and the EU ETS. The shift to diversity and fragmentation has set-in in the recent years and reflects a trend in which various climate-related institutions start to overlap, and more non-state actors (such as companies, citizens) and lower-levels of government (such as cities) are claiming a pro-active role.<br/><br/>Topics are illuminated from the political and policy perspective by the Environmental Policy group (ENP) and from the economic perspective by the Environmental Economics and Natural Resources group (ENR).

  "<p>Recent decades have seen major changes in the ways social development is conceptualised and practiced. Key contemporary issues like global environmental change, widespread agro-industrialisation, rural to urban migration, and economic globalisation reflect development realities starkly removed from earlier periods, as well as unprecedented degrees of inter-dependency between rural and urban, and global and local. The emergence of a professional development industry of policy advisers and on-the-ground expert consultants both mirrors and drives this process: knowledge of development is gained and distributed across multiple scales.<br/>This course introduces students to the sociology and anthropology of development, with a particular focus on how knowledge interacts with rural innovation processes and social change. By examining theories and concepts alongside concrete issues, it seeks to enable students to effectively analyse and evaluate development problems and opportunities. Specific emphasis is placed on uncovering the partial and contingent nature of development knowledge: how can critical reflection on field-based research help us to understand the contemporary context? As we act to deal with the myriad development challenges we face, where is the knowledge of local 'managers' of environments and developments to be located?<br/>The course presents an introduction to the basic principles of development studies enquiry from a sociological and anthropological perspective, and outlines critical challenges relating to power, discourse, and environmental change. Strong attention is given to the study of local actors by development researchers and practitioners, and thus how 'local agency' might be reconciled with a concern for political, economic, and socio-cultural contexts. Theoretical exploration is interspersed with discussion of a variety of challenging themes including resource use, livelihoods, environmental degradation, and participation. Emphasis is placed here on how development policies are interpreted and influenced by local actors, the relationship between the intervened upon and those intervening, and the need for interrelated scales of explanation and analysis in order to understand development problems and thus the possibilities for social change.</p>",

  "This course is an introduction to legal anthropology with a focus on the different ways in which law, governance and policy affect the management of, and conflicts on, natural resources. It entails legal anthropological theory and case studies on: property, authority, land tenure, policy making, governance, semi-autonomous social fields, certification, human rights, vulnerability, legal pluralism, multiple governance, interactive governance and studying up/down/through of policy processes. It pays attention to different uses of law and emphasizes the importance of both contextually, and the interaction between actors within social groups and between those groups.\r<br/>Central in this course is the way in which law affects people's access to natural resources and its effects on the sustainability of the use of these resources. A number of developmental themes is explored in which the role of law is analysed. Among these are: land grabbing, private regulation of palm oil, human right, national development programming and climate change.\r<br/>The course also includes a short philosophical introduction to the ethical grounding of human rights and the interrelations between law, society and world politics.",

  "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\">The classical roles of governments are the provision of public goods and the prevention of negative external effects. However, the call for more and different kinds of policy interventions has become louder. Politicians and citizens demand new types of authorities to control markets, better monitoring systems, and intelligent regulations. These calls are accompanied by new forms of arrangements between government, private enterprises, NGOs, and citizens. With this trend, policy change and governance have become the new 'buzzwords'. Initiatives for policy changes and new governance arrangements come both from grass-roots levels (bottom up), and from public authorities (top-down). In this course, students learn and apply key theories about how policy change takes place in a dynamic governance context. Hereby special attention is drawn to theories covering the various stages of the policy process: agenda setting, decision making, implementation, and evaluation. </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\"></span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\">The course covers full working days. Each day consists of three parts: lectures (except for Fridays), group work in tutorials, and independent self-study. Students use the theoretical insights from the literature and lectures to conduct an in-depth analysis of a specific policy change trajectory in one of the following domains: agriculture,  city management, nature conservation, and energy. The analyses are performed in small groups in the afternoons. The three specific policy change trajectories that students can choose from are (i) the EU Common Agricultural Policy, (ii) the Project 1012 (improvements of de Wallen in Amsterdam), (iii) nature conservation in the Oostvaardersplassen, and (iv) gas extraction in Groningen. The group work consists of three weekly assignments, which make up fifty percent of the total grade for the course.

  "<p>The course is the second part of the introductory course for the BSc Biosystems Engineering (Agrotechnologie in Dutch). The focus of this second part is on application of knowledge, both new and acquired in the first part. You will work on different cases. Each case is introduced with a lecture and is followed by a tutorial or practical in which the theory is exercised. Each case will take one or two half days. In the first week the focus is on challenges and systems analysis. There are many challenges for biosystems engineering for the coming ten year. You will get an overview of some of these challenges and you have to define your own challenges. Systems analysis is an important topic within biosystems engineering. You will become acquainted with the most important aspects of systems analysis; there is also a practical in which systems analysis is exercised. In the second week the focus is on farm relevant side stream valorization. The main question is what would be needed to make more valuable and sustainable products from side streams. The focus here is on (chemical)conversion i.e. the so called ‘farm chemistry’. In the last week the focus is on the use of information technology and operations research and logistics. There are some lectures connected to this and a practical in which the theory is exercised. Integrated in the course is also a module presentation skills. You get the basics for giving a good oral presentation and have to exercise this by preparing and giving several oral presentations. The module Information Literacy started in period 1 (in the course FTE-12303 Introduction biosystems engineering part 1).

The country's role in the world has shifted from a major colonial power to a progressive pioneer. Some foreign developments also appear to be closely intertwined with Dutch politics. This was the case during the two world wars, as well as the Vietnam War or the arms race during the Cold War. In this course, the main events and developments in the history of the Netherlands during the 19th and 20th centuries will be explained, studied and analysed. Although the emphasis is on political history, a broad definition of politics is deliberately applied: relevant social, cultural and economic aspects are also covered in the lectures and the literature. Literature and primary sources are used alongside the lectures. Students also analyse a historical aspect using a source of their own choice and provide a written report. Finally, their knowledge and understanding of the historical evolution are tested in an exam.",

  "This course looks into the relation between food, health and wellbeing from a sociological and political point of view. It discusses how (un)healthy eating is embedded in social structures and framed through political choices made in various policy domains such as agriculture, health, environment and spatial planning. It addresses food security and the accessibility of (fresh and nutritious) food, which is a socio-political issue in 'developed' as well as 'developing' countries. Its relation to inequalities in income and public spending is widely recognized. More recently attention is given to how 'food systems' directly and indirectly affect citizens' health through their effect on the quality of the living environment in rural as well as urban contexts.\r<br/>In most countries 'food', 'health' and 'the environment' are dealt with and governed in and by separate policy domains and institutions. In areas of metropolitan agglomerations, however, there is raising awareness of the interrelation between food, health and environment, resulting in manifold new forms of coordination and cooperation transgressing the traditional boundaries of policy-domains, actors as well as authorities. The emergence of food policy councils and urban food strategies is a clear indication of this.\r<br/>Hence, there is an increasing need to study and govern food, health, environment and society from an integrated and territorial point of view.\r<br/>This course aims to enhance students' understanding of the socio-political aspects that influence the interrelations between food, health, environment and society and that are reflected in traditional as well as novel governance arrangements.",

  "<p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt;color: #333333;\">Sustainability is the idea that development should not be at the expense of future generations, nor the planet. In this course we examine two challenges governing the implementation of sustainability. First, we examine the challenge of<i> communication</i>, asking why sustainability issues are so difficult to communicate? Through what strategies can we change individual and institutional behaviour? How can we empower people to change fundamentally their behaviour and to participate genuinely in sustainable futures? What is or should be the role of dialogue? To answer these questions, we explore and scrutinise theories aimed at communication for sustainability. Second, we examine the challenge of <i>responsibility</i>, asking how we should make responsible use of science and innovation for sustainability. While science and innovation are necessary to develop solutions, it is clear that they also have the capacity to generate new problems, risks and dilemmas. This double-edged quality of science and innovation is rarely understood. To respond to this challenge, we engage with case studies of responsible innovation examining how innovation can be developed with and for society. This course adopts a ‘learning by doing’ approach in which we encourage students to think creatively and critically through group work. In groups, students learn how to critically evaluate and present a social science article on one aspect of the course. In addition, students learn the practical skills of communicating for sustainability a 'wicked' issue of their own choosing. Specifically, they learn how to develop a researchable question, how to translate this into a focus group design, how to recruit, moderate and analyse a focus group (with fellow students), and how to develop the analysis into a presentation and a write-up on a communication strategy for sustainability. The groupwork constitutes roughly 50% of the course overall.</span></p>",

  "<p>The transition towards a circular economy is one of the biggest challenges to realize a more sustainable (biobased) society. This transition requires an interdisciplinary approach, combining technical, managerial, socio-political, and environmental considerations. In this course, we therefore take a systems approach to the circular economy, considering different stakeholder perspectives, their incentive structures, and their impacts on circular alternatives. Since identifying and evaluating potential circular alternatives based on quantitative techniques is key in achieving sustainable solutions, we also learn how to use and integrate strategic management considerations, life cycle assessment and agent-based modeling to assess the management and technical challenges and benefits of alternative solutions in specific, often complex settings. By integrating all perspectives in a case study, we learn how to comprehensively and critically assess strategies to transition towards a circular economy.</p>",

  "<p>This course explains and elaborates a political ecology approach to analyse water governance and intervention. Political ecology is a body of combined theoretical approaches that have in common that they put politics and  power relations at the heart of the analysis of social struggles over natural resources (that is, knowing, intervening in, and governing nature). Political ecology approaches thereby focus on context and history-rootedness; the social and political construction of nature and natural resource governance (socio-natures); multiple, dynamic and interlaced scales; while aiming to understand and support ' environmental justice' . The course comprises three highly related themes: (1) introduction to the political ecology debates and approaches and their application to water questions; (2) the critical analysis of water governance interventions and reforms of the water sector; and (3) the exploration of alternative strategies for  knowing, distributing and governing water as informed by different political ecology approaches.<br/>Over the past decades a growing body of experience and knowledge has developed on the institutional, organizational and political aspects of water management, such as the development of water users organizations and participatory irrigation management, participatory design of irrigation infrastructure, development of pluralistic water rights frameworks, cultural politics of water- based identities, payment for environmental services and market-based governance models, reform of water policies and bureaucracies, understanding and composition of multi-scalar ' hydro-social territories' and grassroots struggles for water justice. <br/>This course covers these topics by presenting concepts and methodologies derived from the political ecology approaches that consider equity and democracy as key concerns in studying and transforming 'government water agencies', market-environmentalist water policies, local water management organisations, and water-based mobilizations and grassroots movements. This is placed in the context of wider developments in the water sector as well as contemporary policy and governance debates. The focus of this course is not only on providing analytical tools allowing students to unpack the mechanics of power, but also on empowering both students and stakeholder organisations to jointly engage in a process to design countervailing strategies that result in a more just distribution of both access and governance of water resources.</p><p>The study of the Groningen gas extraction case forms an integrative element of the course. We will visit various stakeholders in Groningen during a one-day excursion, and students write a group essay on a topic related to the Groningen gas extraction case applying concepts presented in the course.</p>",

  "TRENDS in Forest and Nature Conservation is developed by the four chair-groups (REG, PEN, FNP and FEM) teaching the Master Forest and Nature Conservation (MFN) programme and some external invited speakers. The course is directed to first year students from the Master in Forest and Nature Conservation (MFN) programme and complemented with students from other master programs.<br/><br/>The course addresses the current challenges and trends in conservation and ecosystem management from ecological and social perspectives. Conservation attitudes, targets and strategies have changed dramatically in the last four decades (Mace 2014, Science 345: 1558-1560). In this course we analyze 6 trends in nature conservation. Each of these trends is explored within one thematic block through a series of lectures and the discussion in groups of one scientific paper. Students further reflect on these trends through individual essay writing and a group science-based communication project aimed at a broad public audience. <br/>Block 1: Resilience of socio-ecological systems. Trend: Increasing awareness of the potential persistence and irreversibility of alternative states in socio-ecological systems.<br/>Block 2: Governance and Policy. Trend: Recognition of the cultural plurality in visions of nature and knowledge on ecological systems including indigenous people and different ways of governing nature and their effectiveness.<br/>Block 3: Protect versus Manage (Spare vs. Share). Trend:  Increasing recognition that most nature is not pristine and value conservation also in managed ecosystems.<br/>Block 4: Ecosystem approach. Trend: Recognition of the importance of species interactions for maintaining the structure, functioning and biodiversity of ecosystems.<br/>Block 5: Success Stories. Trend: Environmental scientists and conservation professionals understand the need of highlighting not only the problems but also the successes.<br/>Block 6: Manifesting science.

  "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11.0pt;\">Today, landscape architects and planners are confronted with new challenges. One of these challenges is the shaping of foodscapes. Foodscapes are places and spaces where food is produced, processed, acquired, distributed, consumed and the waste processed. The notion of foodscape is increasingly being used within landscape design, spatial planning, health promotion and food studies as a tool to describe our food environments and to assess the potential impact on food choice and food behaviour. Foodscape is a concept of growing importance on the path towards more sustainable and healthy lifestyles. </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11.0pt;\">Food is a socio-technical system and as such is shaped by everyday practices that are performed in specific places. The food system is enacted by the repetitive performances of everyday food practices. Transitioning the food system involves changing the practices that constitute and reproduce them. Cities in this perspective are tightly bundled agglomerations of everyday practices, and are the stages on which healthier and more sustainable practices are created, performed and repeated, until they become everyday activities. Cities are therefore uniquely positioned to change food practices, and by doing so transition socio-technical regimes like food and sustainable environmental management. Municipal policies, programs, and infrastructure influence practices, while activists, political leaders and media teachers shape our understanding of practices. By strategically influencing food practices, cities can potentially advance public health, improve the environment and economy, and ultimately transform the food system. </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11.0pt;\">Lifestyles represent practices comprised of interests, opinions, behaviours, and behavioural orientations of an individual, group, or culture. Hence, lifestyles reflect values and world views, including views on politics, religion, health, music, sexuality and food. Cities are hotbeds of lifestyle change. Food habits and convictions can be construed as part of a lifestyle such as conventional, locavore or ecological. Various lifestyles are associated with disparate foodscapes. </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11.0pt;\">Contemporary food practices and the consequent shaping of food places and spaces can be framed as social practices contributing to or deriving from the path to sustainability. Food and its manifold spatial manifestations is key to understanding emerging alternative niches which may eventually have a positive impact on unsustainable spatial structures and institutions. Research by design and the exploration of alternative spatial arrangements among others may provide tools for opening up views on sustainable foodscapes and healthy lifestyles. </span></p><p><br/></p>",

  "<p>A series of lectures combined with practicals on literature study, reading, visual and text analyses and a field seminar.<br/>It has often been remarked that any new assignment in landscape architecture and planning takes place in what is almost always a historic environment. They are situated in temporal and geographical contexts. These contexts express divergent cultural-historical, socio-economic, political and legal conditions. Aspiring landscape architects and planners are supposed to be able to construe, understand and evaluate the historical development of landscape design, place making and spatial planning in our contemporary society, in the course of time against the background of changing societal and professional institutions. Therefore, this course offers a broad historical overview of the genesis of landscape artefacts as well as the genesis of the professions that created these artefacts and their respective disciplines in the widest sense (including architecture and urbanism). The questions to be answered are: from which different traditions did it grow, how did it come into being? <br/>The course combines two perspectives. The first is the inside-out perspective; it  focuses on the intricacies of the profession and its attributes (schools, journals, tools, education, codes of ethics). The second is the outside-in perspective. It emphasises external forces that have moulded professional practices and convictions in Europe, the US and non-western cultures like China and Japan. It outlines these histories in relation to the history of art, nature, technology and culture in general and tries to interpret their scientific and artistic meaning within the current debate on the goals of landscape architecture and planning among the other design disciplines. Focusing on the modern era, i.e., from c. 1500 to present, western as well as non-western roots of contemporary landscape design and spatial planning are presented and discussed. International practices and pioneers as well as scientific and artistic (landscape design) ramifications are highlighted in order to offer a backdrop for understanding current national professional achievements and artefacts in their proper historical context.<br/>During a 5-day seminar in a city outside the Netherlands we will apply acquired knowledge through study, drawn and written analysis, discussion and the execution of assignments in situ.<br/><br/></p><p>5 days Excursion to Paris<br/>The excursion is an obligatory part of the course.

  "Religious fundamentalism seems to be on the rise and it seems to threaten open and democratic societies. But what is it? And how have different fundamentalisms evolved into their current forms? Since the end of the Cold War, Western powers have focused increasing efforts on fighting religious fanaticism. Most of us see images of Islamic fundamentalists, or irrational Christian evangelists in the media and in social media. Yet fundamentalism is more complex than these images. And religion continues to play a key role in the Western world, offering a vehicle for differentiation, cohesion and identity. In this course we examine both popular images of fundamentalism and the historical roots of the religions most associated with fundamentalism. We challenge ourselves to define and understand the many fundamentalisms in contemporary culture.\nIn this course, we therefore gain knowledge about the past to better inform our understanding of the present. We examine the opposition between fundamentalism and modernisation, between tradition and progress, constancy and renewal, and unity and multiformity.\nThis course considers the phenomenon of fundamentalism with the tools of cultural history, examining selected historical expressions of Christian, Jewish, and Islamic fundamentalism from the Enlightenment to the present day.\nPlease note: The lectures of this course are in English.

Deze cursus richt zich op de conceptuele geschiedenis van Europa. Centraal staat het uitgangspunt dat de Europese geschiedenis een proces is dat wordt gedreven door visies van historische actoren op het verleden, heden en de toekomst van Europa. In deze cursus leer je herkennen welke wisselende betekenissen en normatieve ladingen politici, bestuurders, activisten en intellectuelen aan het begrip ‘Europa’ en nauw verwante concepten als ‘Mitteleuropa’ en de ‘Duitse Kwestie’ hebben toegekend. Grepen zij in hun ideaalbeeld van Europa terug op een veronderstelde eenheid op basis van Romeinse en christelijke grondslagen die zij afzetten tegen andere culturen? Of belichtten zij juist de grote culturele diversiteit die Europa kenmerkte? En hoe wilden zij dat politiek vertalen: in een Europa als statenbond, als bondsstaat of als eenheidsstaat? Hoe gingen zij om met de spanning tussen nationale soevereiniteit en Europese eenheid en met de Duitse Kwestie, het probleem van de inpassing van dat sterke, centraal gelegen land in het Europese statenstelsel? In deze cursus analyseer je welke invloed deze opvattingen op de politiek-institutionele ontwikkelingen in de twintigste eeuw gehad hebben.

Relations between dominant organisms will be studied. In the third week, the entire group will receive in-depth limnological training at Lake De Kienehoef (Sint-Oedenrode) and its adjacent pond in the park. The field practical will be linked to lake restoration. This five-day intense field practical includes camping at the site, where the focus will be on the limnology of a deep lake. Irradiance, temperature and oxygen take the lead here: irradiance and temperature steering the process of primary production and oxygen level being the response. However, also other water quality variables will be addressed and a search for the cause of extinction and turbidity will be undertaken. Close attention will be given to some of the key players in aquatic food chains.

The special theory of relativity is not presented as a mathematical algorithm, but still insight is tested by solving numerical problems. The concepts of time dilation, Lorentz contraction, relativity of simultaneity, Lorentz transformation, Doppler shift and E=mc2 are addressed. In addition, some excursions to cosmology and astronomy are undertaken.

Health promotion practices require a shift in emphasis from disease prevention focused messages about risk, to a more ecological and salutogenic approach taking into account social, environmental, and cultural contexts in which people live, work, recreate and play (cities, families, schools, workplaces, recreation and communities). A setting is defined as a place or social context in which people engage in daily activities, in which environmental, organisational and personal factors interact with health and well-being. Settings offer both an opportunity to promote health and well-being, and may also constrain it. In this course we focus on analysing settings, which may include the family/household, educational settings, workplaces, recreation, prisons, hospitals and communities. By means of an in-depth and real-life case study, students will explore a certain health promotion issue from a settings perspective, to get concrete experience with the settings approach. </p>",

The book 'Principles of Ecotoxicology' is used to develop a basis for the rest of the subjects in the course. About half of the lectures will focus on a variety of timely additional issues. In the practical part of the course you will use a set of experiments to identify two unkown chemicals based on their toxicity profiles. Applying a set of modern in vitro and in vivo assays you will address the toxicity of the unknown and compare this with literature data/ Based on this, the identity of the chemicals can be assessed. This will be presented both orally as well as in a small report. </p>",

  "It is widely known that the immune system operates against infection or tumors. However, it is much less known that many mechanisms of the immune system are operating in other physiological responses as well, suggesting interactions between (auto-)immune responses and physiological compartments like behaviour and energy, aging, and nutrient metabolism etc. The introduction course Infections and Disorders focuses on known mechanistic and physiological relationships between infectious agents or diseases, and metabolic-, behavioural- and production-related disorders in food animals and man. After introduction lectures in types of infectious agents (bacteria, viruses, parasites), energy metabolism, (mal)nutrition, and (mal)behaviour, and aging, several important diseases will be presented, illustrated and discussed. Especially diseases which are important on the level of the farm, sector and human health. Cases with respect to feed, welfare, and production in combination with examples of diseases and disorders of cattle, pigs, poultry, horses (and man) will be subject of this course.",

The schedule for the academic year at Breda University of Applied Sciences differs from the schedule of Wageningen University. The periods mentioned are the periods of Wageningen University.<br/><br/></p><p>The destination is a key element of the tourism system and a central focal point in tourism research. As such, destinations can be understood as geographically localised clusters of tourist attractions, services and goods managed and marketed for tourist consumption. However, tourism destinations do not exist in a vacuum, but are a part of a wider socio-cultural, political and economic context. In this sense, they are in many ways inseparable from everyday lives of local residents and workers. This complexity poses challenges for understanding, managing, and governing tourism destinations. To deal with it, the course adapts an interdisciplinary approach, building on perspectives from tourism management, sociology, political economy, governance/development studies and cultural geography. The course is organised around three distinct theoretical perspectives on destinations: 1) Destinations as a combination of tourism products, services and experiences 2) Destinations as networks and 2) Destinations as imagined and lived places.<br/></p><p></p><p style=\"font-size: 14px;\">The aim of this course is to provide students with an understanding of ways in which tourism destinations can be analysed, strategically managed and governed to facilitate development in a local as well as global socio-economic context.</p><p><br/></p><p></p>",

In fact, many people associate 'development' with the uptake of new technology, and have high expectations of its potential benefits in addressing poverty, diseases, and environmental degradation. Others point to the downside of technology and emphasize how technologies intensify existing inequalities and create tensions in society, for example in the access to natural resources. In this course we use three theoretical frameworks to examine how the impacts of technology on development and the use of natural resources are mediated by interactions and negotiations between different actors. Real life situations in India, the Philippines and Namibia are used to apply concepts for assessing how the interactions between technology, natural resources and society create enabling or constraining conditions for sustainable development.</p>",

  "This course offers a survey of theories and issues related to communication across cultural borders. Intercultural communication is the circumstance in which people from diverse cultural backgrounds are engaged in communication. This can be through interpersonal contacts, speech and non-verbal communication, through international organisations, business contacts, change interventions, audiovisual mass media and all kinds of written texts. Besides the focus on the study of intercultural communication as a process, the consequences of intercultural communication, such as changing identities and cultural globalisation/localisation, are also analysed. General topics that will be covered are paradigm shifts in thinking about culture and communication; cultural globalisation and cultural localization and the central role of symbols in intercultural communication. The course will create a platform to explore areas of interest such as: changing identities; religions; gender issues; social and family issues; the existence of different worldviews; the role of the mass media; individualism vs. collectivism; the role of language; time and space across cultures; the role of culture in international development; multicultural health care.",

  "This course is part of the Autumn semester 'Agroecology' at ISARA, Lyon, France.<br>\r<br/>In this module, students will deal with different real-life projects. In groups they will analyse a demand from an external client (technical institutes, regional agricultural departments, research centres, associations, private companies) during the whole third semester. The objectives are to use different methodological and project management tools (defining leadership, time schedule, deliverables), and to apply disciplinary knowledge acquired in previous courses (semester 1 and 2). In addition a self-reflection process of the students is implemented (contribution to the team work, assessment of the function in the group). The self-reflection can be carried out either during an interview with a professor or with a written document. The principle group work will be a literature review, field work or surveys in order to qualitatively and quantitatively analyse collected data and discussion their findings in group presentations with the external clients.",

Why did the Industrial Revolution take place in England and not in China? Why could other western countries easily catch up with England, while large parts of Asia, Africa, and South-America remained underdeveloped? Many theories and concepts have been developed to help answer these questions, ranging from the role of climate, culture or population, to the institutional approach that is currently fashionable.

  "All over the world human societies are intervening in river basin water flows. More and more these interventions reduce or exceed the carrying capacity of water systems. And climate change is expected to aggravate this. To improve management of our water resources, now and in the future, we need to better understand interactions between human interventions and water system functioning. <br/>The IWM course addresses such interactions by discussing water management issues characterized by ambiguities in problem definition and uncertainties in knowledge, and by multiple governance contexts and upstream-downstream connections. <br/>You will acquire the capacity to analyze such issues and to propose and critically assess research strategies. To do so systems thinking approaches to water management research are  taught and you learn how to define relevant research questions. <br/>Integrated Water Management issues around Wageningen are used as illustrations throughout the course. But the course does not limit itself to the Wageningen context. Integrated water management is an approach with many faces. The understanding of a small farmer in Peru, for instance, will be completely different from that of an international river basin manager in Europe. As integrated water management is context dependent, you will learn to identify underlying assumptions and traditions. And you will be able to apply your analysis skills and your knowledge on methodologies in other continents and situations.",

  "Environmentally-friendly and efficient production of high-quality products from our natural (agricultural) resources will be one of the key challenges for the coming decades. <br/>In this course we will study the influences of different choices in production methods and product. New milder processing methods will enable more efficient use of raw materials and lessen the need for a cooled distribution chain. Using alternative ingredients for the same product may imply better use of land, energy and water and result in a lower emission of greenhouse gasses. However, the evaluation of existing and new technologies is difficult and requires appropriate evaluation instruments, plus a process system design that allows optimal use of resources and technologies. This course will provide instruments for both evaluation and sustainable process system design. <br/>A number of methods will be introduced, that allow the evaluation of food production systems (from large-scale supply chain, factory level, down to product and unit operation level) on efficient use of raw materials, energy, water and other utilities. These include the use of Sankey diagrams for visualization of mass, water and energy balances over complex systems. We will discuss the fundamentals of the concept of the quality of different streams (exergy), which can be visualized with Grassman diagrams. <br/>In addition to the lectures and working classes, practically relevant cases will be investigated and options for improvement evaluated.

  "This course problematizes the different ways that programs and policies of governance shape the livelihoods and socio-ecological environments of people - especially in the South. Special attention is paid to environmental distribution conflicts from a political ecology perspective as an important approach in development sociology. Central to political ecology is a concern with inequality and how this relates to material struggles over access to and control over natural resources and socio-ecological environments. Globalisation and political-economic processes in the neoliberal era have brought about new types of governance, characterised by a blurring of the divide between the public and the private, and a changing role of the state. In the course we discuss various perspectives on these trends: viewed from historical materialist and poststructuralist political ecology perspectives, this new governance architecture has enabled the development of new material livelihood strategies, new technologies of government (governmentality), and new forms of subjectivity. <br/> <br/>The first part of the course introduces the field of political ecology and delves into some of the basics of natural resource distribution and how this affects people’s livelihoods. We will start with outlining how and why the field of political ecology developed and evolved, and then pay specific attention to the governance of natural resources and how this has been changing over the past decades under global neoliberalism. The second part of the course sets out to explore possible alternatives to the current neoliberal dominant order. Such an enquiry takes political ecology into the ‘ontological’ realm by shifting the analysis from the empirical level to a focus on people's different ways of ‘being in the world’, and the ways these inform other ideas about governing resources. Attending to such ontological encounters will deepen our sense of expanding our sense of possibility in an era in which it is sometimes said that it is easier to imagine the end of the planet than a change in the economic system. We will finish by discussing how everything we addressed is currently being complicated by implementation of the United Nations’ new Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).",

See for more information: https://tcs.sites.uu.nl/\nThe Arab Spring in the Middle East, the Orange Revolution in Ukraine and the Rose Revolution in Georgia are only some of the most prominent examples of revolutionary revolt on a massive scale in recent years. Revolutions seem to occur everywhere on the fringes of Europe, seem to easily cross national borders, and shape the world we live in in unexpected ways. At the same time, revolutions are the topic of intense debate among scholars: how should they be appreciated and understood? Do revolutions cause chaos, civil war and unrest? Or, are they, instead a catalyst for the development of democratic societies and social justice? Furthermore, how and why do revolutions actually occur? And why do some revolutions succeed while others fail?\nThis course focuses on the explanations for revolutions and other forms of political upheaval in a long-term historical perspective. The course investigates four different academic theories which claim to explain the causes, developments, and consequences of revolutions, coups and regime changes. We particularly focus on social class, the actions of the state-elites, ideology, and transitions to democracy. We apply these different explanations to concrete historical and recent instances of political upheaval, from the eighteenth century right up to the Arab Spring in the world of today. Students learn to weigh up different explanations and develop an understanding of the various dynamic processes that determine the course and consequences of revolutions. In their own individual research project, students finally apply these various explanations to investigate a concrete revolutionary case in past or present.",

  "This course is about transport of chemicals by flowing water which affects soil and groundwater quality. During this course students will get acquainted with different aspects of solute transport in the subsoil. It contains lectures, a laboratory practical and a computer practical.\r<br/>During the lectures, the physical and mathematical backgrounds of the convection-dispersion equation CDE for solute transport in soils and groundwater are discussed in detail, because the CDE is currently the basis of almost all scientific and commercially available solute transport software. The CDE is critically compared with stochastic-convective (SCM) or stream tube solute transport modelling to clarify the weak and strong points of either approach. SCM are very powerful and mathematically simple tools for addressing transport in heterogeneous soils and groundwater systems. Both ion exchange and adsorption/desorption effects on solute transport are shown. The soil hydraulic properties (retention curve, conductivity function) are discussed in relation with flow and (solute) transport. Different preferential flow mechanisms are outlined, together with their effects on solute movement, field observations methods to detect preferential flow, and modelling strategies at the local and at the regional scale.\r<br/>As a computationally efficient and elegant alternative to solving the CDE, random walk simulations are discussed in class and demonstrated during the computer practical. The basic theory underlying the CDE and the stochastic-convective transport models is illustrated for a number of broadly relevant application areas, such as salinity and sodicity hazards in natural ecosystems and agro-ecosystems, pesticide and heavy metal leaching. Relatively simple mathematical tools such as moment theory are provided to give hands-on experience with applying the different transport concepts. Illustrations of complicated transport phenomena in case of spatiotemporal variability and for multicomponent transport processes are explained, giving a clear link with the laboratory and computer practicals.\r<br/>The laboratory practical involves monitoring water flow and solute transport in a soil column by various sensors driven by a data logger, soil sampling in the field, various standard soil physical techniques (measurement of saturated hydraulic conductivity and the water retention curve), and several other methods and techniques.\r<br/>During the computer practical emphasis is put on numerical techniques to simulate solute transport in saturated part of groundwater. First attention is paid to the different transport processes with the aid of ready maid models (applets) which are based on several analytical solutions. Next students need to derive different numerical approximations of the CDE which need to be implemented in a spreadsheet to develop numerical models. To clarify certain transport processes, an alternative to the CDE, the Random Walk method will be implemented in a spreadsheet as well. Finally commercial software will be used to setup a three dimensional groundwater and transport model including a heterogenic conductivity field. Mass moment calculations illustrate the effect of the heterogeneity on a contamination plume.",

  "Mass and heat transport phenomena play a key role in on water technology. Therefore, every student Water Technology should be familiar with the basic principles of transport processes. Think of mixing solutions in a reactor tank, pumping fluid from one vessel to another or heat loss to the environment. A typical question students should be able to answer at the end of the course is, for instance, how much power is needed to keep a reactor vessel at a certain temperature given the specific heat capacity of water, the volume of the tank, the heat loss to the environment and the rate at which the tank is perfused with fresh medium of lower temperature. The emphasis of the course is on analyzing a practical problem, translate the process in a model, i.e., mathematical terms, solve the mathematics and interpret the conclusions derived from the calculation. <br/>Specific topics discussed during the course include:<br/>- General Balances (for mass, energy & momentum; micro and macro balances);<br/>- Dimension analysis, (e.g., in up-scaling a process);<br/>- Hydrodynamics & Flow (laminar versus turbulent flow, continuity equation, friction factors, Fanning equation, Bernoulli equation, frictional forces, flow regimes, drag coefficients, Reynolds umber, boundary layer, Prantl number, Schmidt number);<br/>- Heat Transport (stationary and non-stationary conditions, conduction versus convection, Fourier, Newton' s cooling law, heat transfer coefficient, Nusselt number);<br/>- Mass transport (stationary and non-stationary conditions, diffusion versus convection, mass transfer coefficient, Sherwood number).",

The organization and dynamics of biological systems rely on an intimate interplay of biomacromolecules. Proteins, nucleic acids and other molecular compounds, such as membrane phospholipids, may interact with each other to transduce signals or to build up macromolecular structures that perform catalysis, shape cells or form intracellular organelles. Cell functioning largely depends on protein interaction networks or, as outlined in Alberts (1998), ‘the entire cell can be viewed as a factory that contains an elaborate network of interlocking assembly lines, each of which is composed of a set of large protein machines’. Unraveling protein interaction patterns is therefore of key importance to increase our understanding of cellular processes. The scope of the first part of the course is to quantitatively determine several physical properties of fluorescent proteins, e.g. diffusion constants and masses, and to obtain insight in the operation of advanced spectroscopic instruments. We will use steady-state fluorescence spectroscopy, time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy, fluorescence fluctuation spectroscopy and absorption spectroscopy to measure signals from the purified fluorescent proteins. In addition to the fluorescence spectroscopy measurements, mass spectrometry (MS) will be performed on the same protein samples in order to identify and study relative quantitative amounts of proteins present .",

By conducting an irrigation experiment in the irrigation tunnel (volume-balance method) you gain understanding in:</p><p>- the advanced principles of surface hydraulics;</p><p>- the requirements to calibrate the soil infiltration characteristics for optimisation of surface irrigation;</p><p>- the principles of performance evaluation and the factors affecting the optimisation of surface irrigation to increase efficiency and minimise water losses.</p><p>In conducting the experiment and evaluating its results in a report (performed in a group of 4-5 students) you are also schooled in:</p><p>- setting-up a field experiment and conducting accurate measurements;</p><p>- data management and processing;</p><p>- critical evaluation of measurement data, weighing of alternative methods, assessing of errors, and valuing of best methods.</p><p>The group report will be marked and constitutes the examination of this part.</p><p><br/></p><p>1-B: Design of on-farm pressurised irrigation system.</p><p>As water is getting scarce and the pressure to become more efficient with water in agriculture increases, the second practical of the course is dedicated to the design of a pressurised on-farm irrigation system. In pairs (2 persons) you will be tasked to make a design for an on-farm pressurised irrigation system (drip, sprinkler or micro-sprinkler) for a farm in Spain. Through this 2 week design practical you will gain understanding in:</p><p>- the hydraulics of pressurised irrigation systems;</p><p>- evaluation and cost-performance criteria of pumps;</p><p>- design criteria and dimensioning of pressurised irrigation systems;</p><p>- assessment of investment &amp; operational costs of pressurised irrigation systems;</p><p>- socio-economic impacts of transition from surface irrigation to pressurised irrigation.</p><p>This part consists of lectures, design tutorials and a half day excursion. Your design (report) will be marked, and your knowledge of the theory of pressurised irrigation systems will be tested in the course exam.</p><p>Block 2: Salinity Management</p><p>The long-term sustainability of irrigation (whether surface or pressurised) may be undermined by prolonged accumulation of salts in the soil and groundwater tables, as attested by the millions of hectares of irrigated land taken out of production to-date as a result of salinisation. To avoid these negative impacts, measures need to be taken to flush salts out and avoid their accumulation in the soil and/or groundwater. Through lectures and calculation exercises you will be versed in:</p><p>- calculating long-term salt balances under various agro-climatic conditions;</p><p>- determining the effects salinisation has on crop production and long-term soil properties;</p><p>- the measures that can be taken to avoid salinisation;</p><p>- calculate the leaching requirements for any given agro-climatic condition and water source quality.</p><p>Your knowledge of this field will be tested in the course exam.</p><p><br/></p><p>Block 3: Water productivity, performance &amp; economic value of irrigated agriculture.</p><p>In this final block (5-6 lectures) we take a step back to expand our view to the scales of irrigations systems and water catchments. How do efficiency, productivity and economic value indicators perform at larger scales of analysis? How do water savings at field level (painstakingly obtained in block 1 &amp; 2) accrue to water savings at irrigation system or water catchment level? Are productivity gains at field scale transferable to system or catchment scale? How can the application of performance indicators help understand issues affecting the allocation and distribution of water, agricultural production and their socio-economic impacts? Through lectures &amp; literature you gain insight on how performance indicators can be applied to address these questions in a quantitative manner. Your knowledge of these will be tested in the course exam.</p>",

  "The form and content of politics have changed considerably over time. Political struggles have been fought not only over the institutional forms of political organization and the legitimacy of political authority. Throughout history different answers have also been given to the question what can be considered ‘political’ in the first place. From a historical perspective the domain of politics – or ‘the political’ – is not a given. Where does politics take place? Who participates in politics? Who exerts political power and how? What is the appropriate unit of political organization? Who belongs to the political community? How and why do certain issues become – or cease to be – political?\n History of Politics examines these questions in specific historical settings and circumstances, and asks what the answers to these questions mean for how we think about politics today. It introduces students to several central themes in the history of politics from a long-term European and, occasionally, global-comparative perspective. Amongst other topics, we will discuss: conflict, order, and violence in various political realms (cities, states, empires), revolutions, modes of political mobilization and action, political leadership, mass politics, nationalism, nation-states, decolonization, feminist politics, and politics beyond the nation-state. Proceeding chronologically through several key-stages in the period 1500-2000, we will approach these broad themes by zooming in on specific case-studies, drawing on historical methodologies, investigating primary sources, and discussing secondary literature.",

  "This course is about the operation of Intellectual Property Rights (IPRs) and their roles in research and innovation, notably in the fields of genetics, food and agriculture. Intellectual property rights are increasingly important in society. They are an important tool in innovation policies and have more recently become a major issue in trade and development policies. In the past few decades intellectual property rights have been connected to globalization and the emergence of globally operating industries.\r<br/>Intellectual property rights have also become an important issue in the life sciences themselves. Patent databases are an important source of information next to the scientific literature; patents are equivalent to a high level publication in the career of public sector scientists; and for universities intellectual property protection is increasingly important for generating revenue and as a strategic tool for partnerships. On the other hand, the increasing number of patents in the life sciences requires careful scrutiny by scientists of what research materials are available and under what conditions. Together with national and international regulations governing access to genetic resources, it can be difficult to get access to knowledge, technologies and genetic material for those working in the food and agriculture industries.\r<br/>(Guest) lecturers from different disciplines will discuss the legal, technical and socio-economic aspects of various Intellectual Property Rights, including patents, copyrights, plant breeder's rights, trademarks and geographical indications.

  "Sustainability is a growing concern in the design and operation of many production and supply chain activities. Next to the traditional economic concerns, companies therefore also increasingly consider the environmental and social impacts of their activities. To support these initiatives, and to improve the related decision-making processes, a solid foundation of quantitative methods for sustainability analysis is required.<br/>In this course, you learn how to systematically and quantitatively evaluate sustainability, and to optimise and redesign sustainable supply chains. Definitions and concepts of sustainability are explained and discussed. You will learn how to quantify the sustainability of products and production chains, both for existing supply chains as well as for novel, re-designed, or circular supply chains. Such sustainability assessment involves the selection of key sustainability performance indicators, the collection of data (partially from databases), the quantification of sustainability performance indicators, the benchmarking of supply chains using methods like data envelopment analysis, and the comparison and discussion of the results leading to re-design strategies. In this final comparison and discussion special attention will be given to multi-objective evaluation using (quantitative) operations management methods and stakeholder inclusion. <br/>The course is intended for all third year BSc and MSc students from Wageningen with an interest in sustainability and an affinity with (decision-sciences-based) quantitative analysis. The quantitative approach to sustainability analysis is a key characteristic of the course and students with a background in operations research/decision science and/or process engineering are more likely to successfully complete this course.<br/>Commonly, students are enrolled in the minors Biobased Technology (WUBBT) and Biobased Transition (WUBTR), or in the Master Programmes Management Economics and Consumer Sciences (track ORL), Biosystems Engineering, or Biotechnology.",

  "The powers and limitations of the state, and the relation between the state and its citizens have recently become more important in development theory. State governance has to deal with pressure from international organisations, multinational corporations, and non-governmental organisations. States also experience growing civil society pressure to improve state performance and democratic control. Law plays a central role in shifting state powers and responsibility. Many states operate under a certain 'rule of law' that forms the core of a state's legitimacy to rule over its citizens. But what does the rule of law in black letter mean for government practices, and how can the rule of law be promoted in the context of continuing power shifts?\r<br/>This course examines the search for legitimacy of governance by both state and non-state actors and the role that law plays in providing legitimacy in the light of the recent trends to shift power and responsibility from the national state to other entities, institutions and organisations. \r<br/>The central concepts are state, law, property, legitimacy, and rule of law. The course not only deals with the theories. By making an analysis of specific cases strengths and weaknesses are examined of major projects and proposals to develop governance arrangements, focusing on power relations and the involved processes of legitimation.\r<br/>In the course special attention will be given to human rights as a normative framework in defining responsibilities of states vis-a-vis its own citizens and across borders. A key question is how these rights have been used by state and non-state actors to both confirm and challenge the legitimacy of government action.",

  "The object of the individual is to survive as an individual. To maintain integrity organisms have developed a highly complex and interactive immune system. Although the immune system of vertebrate species is similar, there certainly is more than one method of individual defence that is successful. In fact, the human immune system is just one of many successful mechanisms that operate in the animal world. To reach a level of understanding of the complex system that will allow us to understand why malfunctions such as autoimmunity and immune deficiency develop, we have to consider the system down to its basic components and their functions. Animals, just like humans, suffer from a range of infectious diseases. As veterinary medicine has advanced, prevention of disease has become a priority as healthy food comes from healthy animals. One of the best means of preventing disease is by creating immunity in the animal. This is usually achieved by vaccination. The aim of this course is to provide advanced knowledge on the functioning of the immune system at both, cellular and organ level as well as its evolutionary development. The expertise level is such that it prepares for an immunological Internship (e.g. with a Bio-Medical Group) or a thesis at the Cell Biology and Immunology Group. The (biotechnical) development of vaccines will be dealt with in another course (CBI-30806). Practical's will deal with immunological techniques, (cell isolation, nitric exide assay, RT-PCR, western blot, ELISA) aiming to understand the host immune response to infection. Practical's also include the histophysiology of immune organs in mammalian and non-mammalian species.",

  "Traditionally, nutrition has been dealing with maintaining health and the prevention of deficiencies. Pharmacotherapy on the other hand usually starts with some form of disease, trauma, or at least a medical complaint. However, the borders between both disciplines are not always clear, and even tend to dissolve. Functional foods and medicines can both be applied to prevent diseases, and medical treatment may involve dietary intervention. This course will introduce the basic concepts of pharmacology and the different classes of medicinal compounds that are in use. Differences and similarities between drugs, nutrients and dietary supplements will be addressed, as well as the way these are discovered and developed into products. Attention will also be given to the consequences of drug formulation for the dose-regimen and effect(s). Examples from clinical therapy will be used to illustrate pharmacotherapy.

  "<p>The course deals with advanced topics of river flow and morphology, emphasizing hydrodynamics, sediment transport and morphodynamics in rivers and streams. It first covers the basics of one-dimensional channel flow by deriving the St. Venant equations, and presents solution methods. Simplifications to the St. Venant equations are introduced that lead to kinematic and diffusion wave approximations, being the bases for flood routing methods. Next, flow curvature and the associated secondary circulation in river bends are discussed, including the derivation of a set of governing equations. The course proceeds with bulk properties of sediment, further focusing on the foundations of bedload and suspended load sediment transport. Bedform dynamics in rivers are subsequently analysed with the main focus on alternative types of bedforms and the associated resistance to the flow. The final lectures address river morphological concepts and introduce one-dimensional analytical models simulating riverbed evolution, both theoretically and in computer exercises. A significant portion of time is dedicated to the analysis of flow, sediment transport and bedform dynamics in the Kraijenhoff van de Leur Laboratory for Water and Sediment Dynamics.</p>",

  "The theory that more equal societies are healthier has been confirmed in many different contexts. This applies as well to the idea that inequality has powerful psychosocial effects. In previous times, the scientific debate was focused merely on income inequality as an independent determinant of health. Nowadays, the debate is centralized around the question how income inequalities interact with many known and unknown causal processes related to the social gradient. <br/>In this course, we will review these processes and study the aetiological pathways used in science to explore the emerging health gaps. Case-studies on e-health and genetics are presented to unfold the theories, concepts and methods of each pathways and to critically reflect whether and how pathways are intertwined. To support students in the analysis and reflection on the pathways, hands-on experts whose job is to reduce health inequalities in practice, will present their approaches.  <br/>The assignments support students in developing an understanding of the pathways and analyse and reflect upon the role of pathways in understanding and enacting upon health inequalities. <br/>This course contributes to the understanding and application of the principle of health inequalities and its concepts, theories and methodologies in science and practice. The social scientific viewpoints of sociology, communication and psychology are reviewed stand alone as well as in counter play with life-sciences approaches (e.g. genetics, nutrition, e-technology), especially those relevant in health care disciplines (general practice, community health care). Innovative approaches, including the Salutogenic Model of Health and Intersectionality, are reviewed for their role in understanding and acting upon the health and well-being of disadvantaged populations.",

The course Theorizing Development: Implications for Research focuses on how scientific writing and research on inequality, marginalization and unsustainability are shaped by wider theoretical trends and traditions. A core question in this course, therefore, is how the choice of a theoretical perspective informs and influences the framing of development research. Students following this course will be provided with the analytical skills necessary to critically analyse important issues in development studies and to understand how theory resonates in problem definition, research strategies and questions, reporting and solution formulation.

Sensitivity analysis is applied to determine the most important input variables and model parameters.

In this course students become familiar with the public health system, and learn more specifically how public health policy is made and how they can support the policy-making process, and how policies and programmes can be implemented and evaluated in a real-life setting. <br/>In our society, health is an important asset as it is a resource for everyday living. It enables children to go to school and develop their potential, adults to work and care for their families and elderly to remain involved in society. Health is more than an individual matter; the functioning of our society depends on healthy people. Therefore, it is of great importance to optimize health and its related lifestyle factors (healthy diet, moderate alcohol consumption, non-smoking, physical activity etc.). Analysis of major health problems and their determinants is needed to develop public health policies and programmes that intend to result in considerable health gains in the long term.<br/>In this course methods will be introduced and explained that support the planning, implementation and evaluation of public health policies and programmes. Relevant theories, concepts and tools will be presented, and illustrated with practical examples. For this purpose, the public health cycle will be introduced. This planning model provides a basic frame¬work for professionals working in the field of public health that can be used for planning, implementing and evaluating policies and programmes. This planning model includes the following seven steps: conduct a needs assessment, support priority setting, formulate aims and objectives, construct a logic model, develop an evaluation plan, perform quality control, and analyse processes and outcomes. During the lectures, training modules and group work you are learning to work with the public health cycle by practicing these seven steps.</p>",

  "In this course students will engage with a question that is topic of widespread debate: what is the meaning of planning in current times? Students will compare traditional notions of planning that emphasized control and restraint, with more recent notions that critically yet pro-actively explore the role of planners in a highly dynamic and uncertain world. Is there a role for theory in addressing contemporary challenges? Positivist and interpretive traditions in planning theory are juxtaposed and placed in a historical perspective, and analysed for their meanings for the address of contemporary planning challenges. What kind of ethical dilemmas do planning researchers and practitioners face in executing their professions? Fuelled by the lectures, the students will approach these questions in small groups and debate their findings with each other. Real-world examples from different contexts and an excursion that is fully bringing to life what the theoretical debates and ethical considerations might mean in practice, will enable the students to connect lessons learned in class to daily reality.

Poverty alone cannot be the explanation for the slow process of rebuilding, as is demonstrated by the impact of the Japanese tsunami of 2011 : here, despite Japan’s wealth, recovery was also slow. In our increasingly complex world, facing growing ecological challenges such examples trigger an important question: why are some societies more vulnerable to shocks and hazards (floods, famines, earthquakes, wars etc.) than others? The way in which society is organized is at least as important as wealth. But what features of society determine whether communities collapse under the strain of natural disasters or other forms of crises, or whether they manage to survive, recover and possibly flourish? A historical perspective can help us answer such questions. Our ancestors also had to cope with shocks. Just as in the present, some past societies proved much more resilient and were able to recover quickly, while others turned out to be very vulnerable. The potato blight of the 1840s gave rise to a truly disastrous famine in Ireland, while in Flanders and the Netherlands, where the potato crop failed just as badly, the consequences were not nearly as dramatic. Understanding what caused the difference may shed light on present-day vulnerability.\nIn the first three weeks of this course you become acquainted with the long-term history of shocks and hazards and with theoretical concepts to analyse the ability of societies to bounce back – the resilience of societies. Subsequently, you select a historical case-study. You are free to choose both a type of case and an approach: a natural or a man-made shock, a twentieth-century crisis or one in the more distant past, a focus on prevention, recovery, or collapse. You analyse your case individually, using primary and secondary sources.

  "<p>Forest and nature management and policy involves making choices about goals and the activities implemented to meet those goals. Plans are often based on theoretical concepts, which guide the choices made and set out broad approaches for how these can be achieved. Stakeholders include the government, private sector, community organisations and civil society organisations. They may work alone, and increasingly, together.  In practice, how plans are made and implemented often deviates from theory. The objective of the FNP-23303 Planning: Theories, Tools and Practices course is to give students grounding in both the concepts and practices of three approaches currently used in to planning and managing ecosystems. The learning outcomes of the course are that students can identify and understand three key planning concepts, critically understand when and how they can be used and be able to apply the concepts and tools to practical cases. <br/><br/>The course starts with a brief introduction to three key different planning concepts and tools in forest and nature conservation and then zooms in to explore the following three approaches and how they work in practice:<br/><br/>1.Ecosystem focused approaches focusing primarily on the planet: using biodiversity agriculture to conserve habitats and species and landscape quality.<br/>2.Landscape approaches that focus on both people and different ecosystems with a geographic area, articulating area based goals and approaches to achieve these. <br/>3.     Value chain approaches that have a strong profit focus concerning how products are governed as they are transformed from a natural resource into a product sold to consumers. <br/><br/>Individual and group assignments are used to provide students with practical insights into applying the approaches by critically reviewing cases of protected areas; a practical field excursion to two tropical timber companies to understand a value chain and certification in practice; a value chain mapping analysis, and analysing developing stakeholders interests in a a landscape plan. External guest speakers provide students with an opportunity to interact with stakeholders and better understand how the approaches work in practice.<br/><br/>A critical analysis of literature on these different planning approaches will be used to help understand the approaches: how they are used and the impacts they have. The analysis also builds students critical analytical skills about the conditions in which these approaches can be used, as well as their presentation skills. <br/><br/>The course concludes by asking students to summarize the sustainability and impacts (environmental, social, and economic) of different approaches currently used. This “reality check” aims to stimulate students to critically examine the extent (scale and geographical extent, actual levels of partnership and co-management/collaboration) and how these approaches are used and their impacts – both positive and negative – to meet diverse societal goals. Students will write an individual paper about how the approaches work, when and where and the advantages and disadvantages of different planning approaches. <br/><br/>Student's knowledge will be evaluated through group and individual assignments (60%) and an exam (40%). Students need to have a minimum partial grade of five and a half (5.5) for all components. Marks for the assignment and exams are valid for one year only.</p>",

  "<p>Note: This course is part of the BSc Tourism, a joint degree programme of Wageningen University and Breda University of Applied Sciences. This course is open to students from other programmes. The course is not delivered at Wageningen University, however, but at Breda University of Applied Sciences. You can register for the course by contacting the course coordinator before the start of the course. The schedule for the academic year at Breda University of Applied Sciences differs from the schedule of Wageningen University. The periods mentioned are the periods of Wageningen University.<br/><br/>The final goal of this course is that students learn to develop a research proposal for a research project. The course takes off with a proper discussion on the essence of doing scientific research. What is scientific research and what is not? Using a practical sociological problem related to tourism that needs to be solved the students first learns to formulate a research objective and appropriate research questions. Then they learn to set up the research project. At the end of the course the students have to submit a complete research proposal. Students will be asked to critically assess each others research proposal. The course will not only focus on the research design, but will also address different basic data collection techniques. One of them, in-depth interviewing, will be trained more extensively. Each student will conduct several in-depth interviews in the field, related to a given research design and interview protocol.</p>",

Strategic choices can only be made with the help of research: about the type of problem to be addressed; the objectives to be pursued; the stakeholders to be involved, etcetera. In this course, students learn what communication research for intervention entails. We zoom in on different types of communication research in terms of approach, objectives and methodology. The development of an individual research proposal in the area of communication for intervention is a central activity in the course, and one around which classes are centred. Students learn how to find out what research is required in connection with an intervention that has their interest, develop a problem statement and research questions, learn to find and use literature, develop a conceptual and theoretical framework, and take decisions about research approach, design and methodology.",

  "Any ecosystem that is managed in order to produce output for human ends, needs nutrient management. This is because nutrient cycles become unbalanced by extraction of products. Nutrient managers must keep nutrient cycles in balance in order to maintain the soil's capacity to supply the nutritional needs of crops and to reduce environmental problems caused by loss of excess nutrients.  This course deals with the science behind these goals of nutrient management and the tools that can help achieve these goals. It covers a range of (agro)ecosystems, including low-input tropical systems, organic farming systems, highly productive conventional European systems, and areas designated for nature development. It deals with situations of both limited nutrient availability and excess. The course begins with a brush up and update on nutrient cycles of soils. The major part of the course is dedicated to implementation of current knowledge for tools to achieve sustainable nutrient management, including policy measures to reduce the environmental impact of agriculture. The assignments are preparatory for an MSc thesis. This course is intended for students with an interest in soil science, agronomy, environmental science, organic agriculture, and (tropical) crop science.",

  "Students of landscape architecture working in design must make many choices in their designs. The evaluation of choices depends on functionality and sustainability of the design but also on aesthetic value. To be able to develop an informed aesthetic evaluation of their own work and that of others the student needs an theoretical framework. This framework needs to be tested and applied for a particular example. In this course the students will be taught about concepts of aesthetics as used in philosophical aesthetics with an emphasis on environmental aesthetics. The course supplies insight into the main discourse of philosophical aesthetics as strung between arts-based approaches and aesthetical theories focused on nature and everyday objects.\r<br/>The course introduces the main theories of art (representational, expression, formal, aesthetic and institutional theories) and the core concepts of the beautiful, the picturesque and the sublime. These concepts will be applied to the specific situation of landscape architecture. As a design discipline between art and science landscape architecture combines characteristics of both and this ethical and aesthetical position is clarified within the course. The course provides a view on the embodied engagement with landscapes by people and on the affordances offered by landscape designs. It discusses the role of representation. The theoretical approach is provided to support the students in formulating theory-based evaluations of their own work in design and of that of the work of others. In the end the students will have to develop and write a critique of a given landscape architecture project.",

  "Teams of 4 to 7 students will work in multidisciplinary teams in a consultancy project. The teams are composed on basis of students' interests and the required disciplinary mix for the execution of the project. Students have to express their interest for a particular project in an application letter addressed to the course lecturers. The projects are related to climate change mitigation and adaptation issues; the commissioner can be a local, regional (province) or a national government (ministry), international NGOs, national institutions like 'Rijkswaterstaat' or regional water authorities, research institutes, public organizations or private companies. Each team is responsible for dividing the tasks among its members, communication with the commissioner, and how the final design or solution will be presented. Each team has an assigned coach and is required to find at least one content coach or expert relevant to the project.  \r<br/>In this course students also study and discuss climate change as a moral problem that raises ethical questions about personal and societal obligations. What is a fair distribution of the burdens of mitigating climate change now and in the future? Can we have obligations to future people at all? How to deal with scientific uncertainty in relation to the effects of global warming?

  "This course starts by critically examining the contribution of social and political anthropology to the field of development studies. This methodological and theoretical background enables us to focus on, and reflexively make sense of the importance of the cultural, political and ideological factors that have shaped the thinking of development from the 1980s onwards. Special attention will be paid to recent theoretical contributions to the critique of ideology and to the construction of (collective) subjectivities. These contributions are important to understand current topics such as indigeneity, poor people's politics, land grabbing, corporate social responsibility, sustainable and eco-tourism, etc. We will also inquire into the current popularity of the anthropocene concept as a potential substitute of the sustainability concept. <br/>The course addresses various theorisations of neoliberalism (as a global elite economic project, as a form of government, and as an ideological construct) to understand variations in policy regimes and planning approaches aimed at bridging the gap between imagined futures and development actualities.  <br/>The course will explore the question: How can critical anthropological theory help us to make sense of neoliberal modernisation processes and the (collective) responses they trigger? What is the social and political relevance of our theories? How can we create room for manoeuvre for reformist or activist intervention strategies in addressing the growing inequities of present-day global development?<br/>Seminal anthropological works will be discussed to gain an understanding of the multiple and unexpected responses to development interventions. It is principally through detailed ethnography research that we can understand the full significance of the making and unmaking of development; the same applies to the complex interplay of 'local' or 'lay' versus 'scientific' knowledge, 'use value' versus 'commodity value', and the global marketing of development policies (micro-finance, cash transfer schemes, participatory budgeting). <br/>This implies that an anthropology of development needs to draw on critical anthropological theory and ethnographic skills so as to gain an understanding of the world of policy on the one hand - the way they travel and re-signified in different contexts - and, on the other, the real world of development interventions and local responses to them. Only in this way we will be able to gain a theoretical understanding of the multifaceted character of development, as an ideological construct and as a set of governing mechanisms meant to make the future predictable.",

To do this we will be dissecting empire to see which processes help to construct it, maintain it, and bring it to its demise. We ask question like: How do we define an empire? Why are empires formed and how do they gain support? How is empire sustained and experienced by both coloniser and colonised? And what are the legacies of empire in our world today? Is the ‘age of empire’ really over? In answering these questions we pay particular attention to the ‘new imperialism’ of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, but also consider to what extent this period referenced older models of empire. We focus on how different forms of culture – from literature, architecture and (pseudo-) science to film and fashion – have been used to legitimise these empires or to contest and undermine them.

  "This course examines the conceptualisation and management of the tourism experience in the context of the broader developments of contemporary tourism. The course is meant for MTO students and others interested in exploring the construction and production of tourism experiences from a range of social science perspectives. The search for worthwhile experiences is a main driving force for tourism. Therefore, to understand tourism, an understanding of tourism experiences is crucial. For example, tourism attractions and popular tourism regions are often shaped by experiential themes, for instance cultural heritage, thrills and adventure, sand-sun-sea, particular leisure activities, romanticism, natural heritage, meeting people, et cetera. As a consequence, it is not surprising that a large amount of attention has been paid in the tourism literature to particular perspectives on the tourist experience, including typologies of tourists, issues related to authenticity, commodification, image and perception, to name just a few. As tourism has continued to expand both in scope and scale, and as tourists' needs and expectations have become more diverse and complex in response to transformations in the world of tourism (and the world at large), so too have tourist experiences. This course will provide students with a broad overview of social science conceptualisations of the tourist experience, from the seminal tourism scholars to more recent attempts to analyse its ever-increasing diversity and complexity, as well as more applied approaches to manage the tourist experience. Students will explore through lectures, discussions and an excursion how these ideas have been, and can be, applied to understand a range of contemporary tourism experiences.",

  "<p></p><p>Analysis of components in food materials is important for research, as well as for quality control. In these applications, the major issue is to be sure that you actually analyse those and only those compounds on which you need information. Since food products typically have a very heterogeneous composition (different classes of components, but also variants of the same molecules) the identification and quantification of specific compounds is often not straightforward. <br/> In this course, the student will learn a range of techniques that are used for analysis of ingredient composition in food products. The basics of these techniques will be explained, as well as the applications, and examples how these are used in industry (quality assurance / quality control), or in academic research. <br/> The course covers 6 topics. Three of the topics are about general practices in research, chromatography and mass spectrometry. Applications of these techniques are illustrated for quality assurance/quality control (e.g. Near infra- red, Dumas, total sugar content and total phenolics), advanced carbohydrate analysis and advanced protein analysis. A main focus in all topics is how variations in sample preparation or measurement conditions influence the results. The methods discussed in the course are applicable in quality control (choice of method) and food research and development. For better understanding examples such as melamin in milk, maillard reaction products and health claims of human milk oligosaccharides are part of the course. The main aim of the course is to understand how these analysis techniques for ingredient composition are used and how the results should be evaluated. Information for all topics is provided through knowledge clips and screenrecordings and practiced in online tutorials. In addition, you will apply the knowledge on research practices and GC/LC-MS in a group assignment about fennel tea.</p><p></p>",

  "This course is dedicated to the hydrometeorology of the urban environment, from the micro-scale at street level to the regional scale. These are approached both in a descriptive manner and in a quantitative manner based on physical principles. The course discusses the physical basis of the urban meteorology and hydrology, followed by modelling and observational techniques to study the urban energy and water balance. So called big data and crowdsourcing methods, as well as urban land use classification are addressed. The course also deals with the physics of the human energy balance, and thermal comfort and its impact on human's health. In addition, the origin and consequences of urban flooding and droughts on worldwide (mega)cities. Part of the course is dedicated to the quantitative role of hydrometeorology in urban planning, such as urban vegetation and wadi's. The knowledge is directly related to end users data and knowledge needs for water management, business, urban design, and public health, via research projects proposed in conjunction with these end users.",

  "<p>Irrigation needs are changing triggered by land use changes and an increasing demand on (irrigation) water. In the past, large-scale irrigation systems were built to supply water to farmers for a limited number of crops, mainly irrigated by surface water diverted from rivers, streams or lakes. Important recent developments include diversifying cropping patterns, changing field irrigation methods, urbanization and increasing non-agricultural water uses (including ecosystem services). As a result river basins are closing, water uses and conservation become increasingly contested, and stakeholders engage in different ways to influence water policies and intervention programs. Irrigation water demands are increasing, intensifying and no longer homogeneous and surface water is often supplemented with water from other sources: groundwater, waste water and/or drainage water. Increasing awareness of these changes led to approaches that include multiple water services, which has repercussions for the hydraulic design of irrigation systems. In this course the needs and repercussions of the above mentioned changes on the design of irrigation systems will be treated. Issues to be studied include:<br/>- a diagnostic framework that tackles the multiple use of water by assessing the dimensions of technology, management, governance and use;<br/>- multiple water requirements for a variety of crops, domestic use, livestock, and environmental needs;<br/>- conjunctive use of rainfall, surface water, groundwater, waste water and/or drainage water for irrigation;<br/>- water governance and institutional reforms to enable this conjunctive use of various sources of irrigation water;<br/>- environmental needs/impacts (groundwater recharge, waterlogging, salinity and drainage and return flows to natural streams).<br/>In the course, a diagnostic framework to assess the current and desired services status to modernize irrigation systems is presented. Five irrigation modalities are treated, i.e. irrigation modernization, the conjunctive use of groundwater, waste water and drainage water and the water governance and institutional reforms to enable this conjunctive use. The course consists of two blocks. In Block 1, students will individually study five e-earning modules of the above mentioned irrigation modalities, whereby each student will specialize in at least two of these modules. In Block 2, students will work in a team with 6 different members (specializing in one of the 5 modalities plus a generalist integrator) to address complex conjunctive use of water resources in a case study area in the Musi Catchment, Telangana State, India. </p>",

  "Mohammed, de profeet van de Islam, is één van de meest invloedrijke maar ook één van de meest omstreden figuren uit de menselijke geschiedenis. Regelmatig is er publiek debat en ruzie, vaak door de media opgeblazen, over wie Mohammed was en wat Moslims en niet-Moslims over hem mogen zeggen. Deze cursus probeert een veelkleurig portret van Mohammed te schetsen. Wat weten we eigenlijk over de historische Mohammed? Hoe verhoudt zich dit tot hoe over Mohammed in verschillende islamitische tradities (zoals de theologie, maar ook het recht, de mystiek, en de kunsten) wordt verteld? Wat zijn de factoren die achter de Westerse beeldvorming over Mohammed staan? En wat is de toekomst van Mohammed in onze globaliseerde maatschappij?\nDeze cursus bestaat uit drie delen. Het eerste deel behandelt kwesties omtrent de historische Mohammed: zijn biografie, maar ook de problematiek van de bronnen. De tweede deel gaat in op de verschillende beelden en functies die binnen de islamitische traditie met Mohammed worden verbonden: theologische doctrines, maar ook alternatieve constructies van Mohammed als filosoof en mysticus, en als figuur in de islamitische kunst. De cursus sluit af met en derde deel over Mohammed in het westen, waarin zijn plaats in de anti-islamitische christelijke en seculiere polemiek, in de Europese literatuur van Dante tot Rushdie, en in de Westerse media wordt belicht.\nVoor studenten LAS en TCS die deze cursus volgen als deel van het kernpakket van hun hoofdrichting geldt een verplichte voorbereiding.

  "Our foodscape is rapidly changing.  The sustainability of our food system is now the subject of daily societal discussions. Consumers are now presented with an colorful choice of organic, sustainable, local, artisan and healthy labels, not only in farmers markets but increasingly in mainstream supermarkets At the same time many organic farmers find themselves in tumultuous times, the chicken sector is in shock due to the fipronil crisis and the dairy sector is searching to reinvent itself due to the confluence of economic and environmental constraints.<br/><br/>But if everyone agrees on the need to produce and consume more sustainably, then why is it so difficult to change the food system? Despite all good intentions, only 6% of land in the European Union is farmed organically. With so many farmers and initiatives showing that sustainable food production is feasible, how can we bridge the gap between “thinking solutions” and “making change happen”? To answer that question, we first need to understand the very different worlds, realities, ambitions and constraints of the many actors in the sustainable food system.<br/><br/>In the course Organic Agriculture and Society we take an in-depth look at the different perspectives of the different actors along the organic supply chain. For example, an organic farmer experiences different constraints and possible solutions than the manager of an organic supermarket or the food policy worker of the local municipality.<br/><br/>In the course we literally follow the supply chain. We start the course in by taking  a look at the big picture; what is happening on a global scale to warrant a radical redesign of our food sector, what do we find in our local foodscape and where do we stand in relation to food initiatives in the agri-food sector. We then jump right in to the organic supply chain, starting with the  farmer and then via the retail chain we eventually end up with the consumer and policy actors. We end the course in the final week by taking a step back and reflecting on what the future has in store for the organic sector and presenting the students’ ideas/plans for bridging the think-do gap in agriculture. We begin each week on Mondays with an in-depth lecture focussed on the theme of the week, which is then followed by  excursions  on Tuesdays and Wednesdays where we will engage with actors along the supply chain and see how it works in the field, Thursdays will be reserved for tutorials where will discuss what has been read, seen and heard during the week and Fridays are reserved for the groups to work on their project.",

The many processes in a metropolitan environment are not at all directly connected to each other, except that they all have in common to take place in the same time and space continuum. It shows that the spatial dimension of geo-data is somehow linked to a temporal dimension.

  "<p>This course considers consumption, technology and innovation in relation to the ‘grand challenges’ of our times, such as climate change, public health, resource depletion, and food security. It explores a number of key questions: how does consumption relate to technology and innovation in the context of the grand challenges? Is innovation inherently good? Does it have unforeseen consequences? And what causes new technologies or other innovations to succeed or fail?<br/>In addressing these and other questions, the course explores the interfaces between consumption, technology and innovation. Such issues are important for a scholarly understanding of consumption in contemporary society (in which technology and innovation are ubiquitous), but are also crucial for those who anticipate a future role involving the use, development, management or regulation of technologies and innovations. <br/>Lectures explore the question of what technology and innovation ‘are’, and the various ways in which they relate to consumption and the grand challenges. The lectures approach these issues from different disciplinary perspectives – sociology, the user perspective, economics, and communication studies – and provide a general introduction to key theories and debates. They also demonstrate the practical utility of the theoretical approaches for understanding ‘real world’ examples. <br/>In order to provide a clear picture of how each approach is distinct, the lectures will address some common themes. These include the effectiveness, success or failure of innovations; processes of invention and innovation; the relation between production and consumption; and the relation between society and the material world. The lectures will also examine different contexts relevant for an understanding of consumption, technology and innovation (e.g. individuals, households, society); consequences – intended or otherwise – of technology and innovation; and connections between everyday life, the broader socio-economic context in which consumption occurs, and the grand challenges faced by contemporary societies (e.g. health, the environment).<br/></p>",

  "Het centrale thema van deze cursus is de bestudering van religie vanuit een antropologisch perspectief. Religie wordt benaderd als een empirisch te onderzoeken, hedendaags en sociaal-cultureel fenomeen. De nadruk ligt niet op doctrines en voorstellingen per se, maar op geleefde religie; de wijze waarop mensen religie beleven en beoefenen in het dagelijks leven. Tijdens de cursus komen centrale auteurs en begrippen aan bod, en wordt er aandacht besteed aan de basiskenmerken van een antropologische benadering. Centraal staat de behandeling van onderwerpen die fundamenteel zijn voor het in kaart brengen van het ontstaan van een religieuze setting en van vormen van collectieve en individuele religieuze ervaringen zoals: religieuze ruimte en tijd, het lichaam en de zintuigen, gender en seksualiteit, ritueel en verbeelding, beelden en voorwerpen, geluid en muziek, media, alsmede macht, geld en politiek. In de hoorcolleges worden de verbanden tussen deze onderwerpen en religie uiteengezet. Daarnaast verrichten studenten zelf aan de hand van kleine onderzoeksopdrachten antropologisch veldwerk naar geleefde religie in een zelfgekozen religieuze setting, waarbij de opgedane kennis uit de hoorcolleges wordt toegepast. De opdrachten vormen de basis van het uiteindelijke onderzoeksverslag (mini-etnografie). De voortgang van de opzet en uitvoering van het veldonderzoek wordt in de werkgroepen besproken en gepresenteerd.",

  "<p></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 11.0pt;\">Only part of the food and feed consumed by humans and animals is digestible by host-derived enzymes in the intestinal tract. Even though protein, fat  and starch will be mostly taken up in the small intestine, part of them escape absorption in the small intestine and together with most of the fibrous carbohydrates and phytochemicals will reach the colon. Here the indigestible food remnants will be utilized by the large intestinal microbiota and converted into a vast array of metabolites that can impact gut health but also have systemic effect on other peripheral tissues. Dietary fibres influence food digestion and nutrient uptake in the upper digestive tract through their physical properties. In addition, fibre fermentation - and phytochemicals metabolism and utilisation in the colon is essential for host’s health. The chemical structure and amount of non-digestible and undigested food components influences the microbiota composition and –activity. The interplay between microbiota and fermentable compounds and between different microorganisms determine the location of fermentation within the colon as well as type and level of fermentation products. One of the most abundant and most intensively studied fermentation products are short chain fatty acids, known as energy source but also for controlling gut barrier integrity. The uptake and metabolic function of SCFAs is strongly related to various health effects. Food uptake and composition, microbiota composition and function and the effect of fermentation products on (gut) health strongly depends on the age of the host and could differ for e.g. infants, adults and elderly.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 11.0pt;\">In this course, food components not digested in the upper digestive tract and their fermentation in the lower tract will be discussed in detail. The functional and structural features of the colon will be explained and related to pathological changes in this last organ of the gastrointestinal tract. You will learn that the process of fermentation can be studied by using <i>in vitro</i> models, <i>in vivo</i> animal models, and advantages and limitations will be discussed. The interaction between non-digestible food components and microbiota activity, as well as the interaction between different microorganisms in the colon will be discussed and visualised. Although having limitations, <i>in vitro </i>simulation models and animal models enable us to predict the behaviour of non-digestible food components in the human large intestine and their benefits for human health. The direct effect of non-digestible food components in human is much more difficult to measure, but will be discussed for specific (patient) populations, also in view of emerging innovative technologies for sampling from humans.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 11.0pt;\">The knowledge on fermentation of food components can be applied to design food products, e.g. a food product that provides satiety (suitable for weight management) or improves gut health and/or ensure a high uptake of dietary fibre (relevant to initiate and maintain a healthy microbiota. </span></p><p></p>",

  "The availability of the primary DNA sequences of organisms has given unprecedented insight into evolution of genomes and the realization that the building blocks of cells share many common elements. This means that traditional subdivisions between animals, plants and prokaryotes begin to disappear. Another effect is the growing need to integrate experimental details from many areas such as bioinformatics, biochemistry, cell biology, physiology and genetics to translate the DNA blue print into a working, living cell. This has given rise to a new field in biology, called systems biology. The primary goal of the Systems-Toolbox is to provide students a broad experimental overview of this new non-reductionist approach to a complex biological problem. Examples are understanding a complex phenotype or finding networks of proteins involved in a biosynthetic or signal transduction pathway.\r<br/>The course is aimed to deal with a selection of the following topics:\r<br/>1. bioinformatics approaches to integrate proteomics and genomics data;\r<br/>2. biochemical analysis and in vivo visualization of protein interactions:\r<br/>- protein interaction assays;\r<br/>- isolation of protein complexes and protein identification by LC/MS/MS;\r<br/>- introducing tagged proteins to visualize protein complexes;\r<br/>3. isolation and characterization of cloned genes for use in various expression systems;\r<br/>4. gene expression analysis:\r<br/>- RT PCR;\r<br/>- laser scanning confocal microscopy; \r<br/>5. basics of FRET detection; relation with other methods;\r<br/>6. advanced microscopic analysis of protein interactions in live plant cells.\r<br/>\r<br/>Depending on the status of a particular project, a choice will be made from the above techniques.\r<br/>\r<br/>The course is run in parallel with A Toolbox in Synthetic Biology (SSB-31312), both in period 5 and period 6. The two courses share common work discussions to broaden horizons and demonstrate where systems and synthetic approaches intersect.

Part 1 positioned the phenotype of an organism, starting with the embryonic development and continuing with the relation between anatomy, function and regulation of organ systems. Part 2 continues with this unique relation of &#34;structure, function and regulation&#34; and emphasizes on how the different organ systems interact with each other to result in the proper function and behaviour of the organism. The organic evolution, classification and phylogeny of animals (especially vertebrates) will be dealt with as well. The basic principles of zoology provide an overview in the biodiversity of vertebrates and how they are adapted in structure and function.<br/>The course is organized in themes, each theme dealing with organ systems at cellular, tissue and organismal level. Each organ system is introduced by lectures explaining the anatomy and then the physiology and regulation of function. Then the organ system is further explored in practicals. An integrative theme -consisting of a case study, a practical, and a problem based teaching module- enables the students to explore the interrelations between organ systems with respect to their anatomy and physiology. Working in small groups, the importance of adaptations in anatomy and physiology of organ systems within/to the environment is explored, while learning to use scientific literature.

To be able to feed future generations, innovations are needed to reduce this figure and to improve the efficiency of the food system. By nature of the product, Food Supply Chains (FSCs) need to be managed and controlled carefully. More and more data becomes available, which provide information that can be used to improve supply chain decisions. <br/>In this course we focus on the use of data science techniques in logistic decision making (e.g. forecasting to facilitate inventory decisions). Food waste at retail outlets can be improved by better demand forecasting, e.g. including weather data to better predict demand and to optimize order quantities accordingly. Next to traditional forecasting techniques, students learn to apply other modern data driven approaches (e.g. machine learning) during computer practical sessions. To compare the different methods and their impact on relevant performance measures such as profit, service level, and food waste, students learn to develop a simulation model of (part of) a food supply chain in Matlab/Python.

These models are important for answering research questions about the time behaviour of these processes and for (re)designing a system.\r<br/>The course starts with the translation of oral and written problems into a mathematical model by organizing the information in sketch, diagram or drawing. Next the non-steady state balances for this system are formulated using scientific knowledge and measurement data.

Ten eerste zal nagegaan worden hoe de nalatenschap van de Revolutie - algemeen staatsburgerschap en Terreur - en het Napoleontisch bewind, is verwerkt in de Restauratie-regimes. Verder wordt gekeken naar de opkomst van moderne politieke ideologieën, zoals het nationalisme, liberalisme, conservatisme en socialisme. Dan komen de gevolgen van de deels mislukte revoluties van 1848 aan bod en de nationale eenwording van Duitsland en Italië. Ook zal gekeken worden naar de politiek en cultuur van het Franse en Duitse Keizerrijk, en naar de imperialistische en koloniale strevingen waardoor de Europese ontwikkeling aan het eind van de negentiende eeuw wereldwijde repercussies krijgt.

  "<p>The purpose of this course is to get insight in the possibilities and the problems concerning the application of biocatalysts for the preparation of chemicals and (bio)pharmaceuticals. The biocatalyst (enzyme or microbial cell) is usually the most expensive part in the process, so it is often immobilised to enable its reuse. The course therefore starts with lectures on the chemistry of immobilisation and on the effects that immobilisation has on enzyme kinetics and transport phenomena. The latter will be illustrated by practical experiments at BPE. The course then continues with 3 PGO cases, in which students in small groups study three different problems: 1) pros and cons of two biocatalytic (or chemical) routes to make a particular fine chemical; 2) enzymatic post-recombinant modification of biopharmaceuticals; 3) the application of biocatalysts to make biobased chemicals or biofuels. Downstream processing and economical aspects should be addressed in all three cases.</p>",

  "<p>The course Research Approaches in International Land and Water Management prepares students to do their own thesis research by helping them appreciate that all knowledge is 'theory-laden' and that 'a problem' can be approached from different perspectives. In particular, the course explores the role and importance of theory in international land and water management research, and helps students develop their own thesis research proposal. A central premise of the course is that all land and water management knowledge is sociotechnical (or socionatural), which is why the question of how to integrate natural science with social science approaches and the different ways of doing this (multi/inter/trans-disciplinarity) receives much attention.<br/>The course is complementary to courses that focus on research methodologies and designing a research project. It is based on the important insight that one's choice of data collection plans and research methodologies is intrinsically interwoven with (1) the objectives and goals of the research and (2) the way in which one makes sense of, and indeed conceptualizes, land and water management realities.<br/>The course is broadly divided in three blocks: 1) Science, knowledge and (inter)disciplinarity in ILWM research; 2) Overview of different conceptual approaches used by chair groups in the MIL programme as requested interactively by your own topic circle and tutor; and 3) Performing a research: the link between conceptual framework and research methodology, again taught in an interactive fashion in topic circles moderated by a tutor. During the course, students are expected to develop the outline of their own thesis research. It is therefore highly recommended that students have already defined (even if only in general terms) their research topic at the start of the course. In weeks 2, 4 and 7 each student will submit an individual assignment covering his/her science perception, conceptual framework, and methodological approach, respectively. In the final week of the course students will present their proposal in the shape of a so-called pitch to peer movie</p>",

Om dit te doen zullen we het imperium ontleden om te zien welke processen helpen het te construeren, te onderhouden en tot zijn ondergang te brengen. We stellen vragen als: Hoe definiëren we een imperium? Waarom worden imperia gevormd en hoe krijgen ze steun? Hoe wordt het imperium onderhouden en ervaren door zowel kolonisator als gekolonialiseerde? En wat zijn de erfenissen van het rijk in de wereld van vandaag? Is het 'tijdperk van het rijk' echt voorbij? Bij het beantwoorden van deze vragen besteden we bijzondere aandacht aan het 'nieuwe imperialisme' van de negentiende en twintigste eeuw, maar bekijken ook in hoeverre deze periode refereert aan oudere imperiummodellen. We focussen ons op hoe verschillende vormen van cultuur - van literatuur, architectuur en (pseudo-) wetenschap tot film en mode - zijn gebruikt om deze rijken te legitimeren of om ze te betwisten en te ondermijnen. Je zult met verschillende bronmaterialen, casestudy's en concepten werken en vervolgens je eigen onderwerp selecteren om onafhankelijk onderzoek te produceren dat de impact van kolonisatie, imperiumvorming en globalisering illustreert.",

  "Vegetation develops in close interaction with surrounding atmosphere, soil and water. In this course we present main findings and issues of inductive and deductive ecohydrological research. We consider ecohydrological interactions both at local and regional scale, and at daily and seasonal time scale. We look at positive and negative feedbacks between vegetation and main habitat factors and how plant growth efficiency is affected by their ability to capture water, sunlight and nutrients. We highlight rain fed and groundwater fed systems, including their transition along a hydrological transect. An important item is the regional interaction between vegetation, soil moisture and groundwater. In addition we analyse the occurrence and origin of typical vegetation patterns. We discuss implications of simple system theory for complex ecosystems and employ both conceptual and physical models for soil water flow and vegetation growth. We discuss experimental techniques to determine soil hydraulic functions and groundwater recharge which are input to physical models. We analyse the flow and connectivity of surface runoff and groundwater systems. We address topical issues in ecohydrology by presenting current ecohydrological research in various climatic regions and by reviewing recently submitted papers.

  "This course addresses basic skills required for research in functional zoology and related fields. The student is introduced to a range of important experimental techniques, such as:<br/>- morphometry;<br/>- biomechanics;<br/>- high-speed video analysis of kinematics of moving animals;<br/>- signal analysis;<br/>- analysis of stresses and strains of muscle and connective tissue;<br/>- measurement of work output by muscle fibres.<br/>In addition, a basic training is given in analytical and numerical modelling using the powerful engineering software package Matlab as a programming environment. <br/>Previous knowledge of Matlab is not required. The theoretical background is offered in the form of lectures, selected book chapters and articles.  The laboratory work consists of several mini-research projects in which questions have to be formulated, an appropriate experimental protocol has to be designed, an experiment has to be conducted, and data have to be analysed and discussed. The topics that will be addressed include:<br/>- muscle structure and function;<br/>- terrestrial and aerial locomotion;<br/>- shape, scaling and allometry;<br/>- aerodynamics of animal flight;<br/>- biomaterials and structures;<br/>- ecomorphology.<br/>Each student delivers written or oral presentations of the mini-research projects. For students with a prior training in modelling, the animal flight practical will involve the development of a computational model. The other students analyze videos of flying animals. Models and experiment will be compared to illustrate the power of a deductive methodology.",

  "<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Urban and rural landscapes are able to provide many different goods and services to society and have a multi-faceted character, which includes natural, cultural and societal values. Landscapes are also economic assets which can offer significant opportunities for the territorial and economic development of metropolitan areas. For example, they serve as a location of economic activities like housing and recreation. Landscapes may also be contested spaces, to which people attach diverse symbolic, economic and political value. Questions of memory and cultural identity, for instance, are often related to the production and the 'conservation' of specific landscapes, but also to their future developments. <br/> Furthermore, landscape and land use are linked, the variety of land uses shapes the landscape. Landscapes are therefore not static, but they are constantly transformed due to planning and design activities, by both public and private actors, but also by the actual use of the people living and working in those same spaces. Questions of belonging and identity have in fact important implications for the economic and political understanding and practicing of landscapes. Land use is thus determined by a wide range of both economic and political factors that are often interlinked. For example, land demand increases because of a growing world population and a stimulation of bio-fuel use. Because of competing claims, specific policies are often implemented to 'govern' metropolitan landscapes. However, these policies are sometimes contested or resisted, especially when governments and markets fail to adequately address these competing claims. For all these reasons, the economics and the politics of landscape need to be understood in depth by planners, policy makers and landscape architects, together with the related implications in terms of landscape governance and questions of social inclusiveness, participation, gender and ethics. <br/> The aim of the course is to provide knowledge about and insight in the economic and political aspects of landscapes use. The questions addressed focus on: <br/>- l</span>and use;<br/>- optimal location of economic activities;<br/>- valuation of landscapes;<br/>- financing location development;<br/>- rural development;<br/>- urban-rural interactions;<br/>- the politics and policy of landscape in all its spatial implications and at the different scales;<br/>- understanding people's actual use of landscape and the cultural and political meanings attached to it;<br/>- the gendered, multicultural and ethical dimension in landscape shaping and use.<br/></p><p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">The target group for this course is students of the bachelor programme Landscape Architecture and Planning (BLP) but students of other programmes interested in landscape economics and politics are welcome.

In a common linear economy approach each individual stakeholder optimises its own situation mainly based on economic and sometimes sustainability criteria. This is not always the overall best situation for all stakeholders in a certain area. The target of a circular economy approach is the achievement of an overall optimisation for all stakeholders and it involves technologies for water as a source for energy, raw materials and reusable water. In order to show the additional value of a circular economy approach, students also develop a business case with the (traditional) linear economy concept as its starting point.

  "<p>Deltas are among the highest populated parts of the world and host many of world's largest cities. Yet, many of these deltas and their inhabitants are under threat as a consequence of combined impacts of sea-level rise and human pressure. This course provides students with insight in physical processes of coastal oceanography and geological processes governing delta evolution, in relation to contemporary threats. The course commences with an overview of tidal theory and geological processes leading to delta development. The role of downstream (sea-level fluctuations) and upstream (freshwater and sediment delivery) controls on deltas are discussed. The focus then shifts to processes in present-day deltas, including sediment dynamics, and oceanography topics such as tidal propagation, wind driven flow, waves, estuarine circulation and river plumes. Geological and oceanography aspects are combined in delta-evolution models, soils and land use are related to delta evolution, and human impacts on short- and long-term delta development are discussed. The course ends with an assessment of the vulnerability of various types of deltas to the combined effects of sea level rise and anthropogenic influences, discussing how the understanding obtained during the course can be used for sustainable delta management.</p>",

  "<p>Note: This course can not be combined in an individual programme with PCC-21802 Introductory Thermodynamics A.<br/></p><p>Thermodynamics is the science that uses the First Law (energy is conserved) and the Second Law (entropy is produced) to describe how systems change when they interact with each other or with their surroundings. Thermodynamics was originally meant to increase the efficiency of steam engines, and has nowadays a prominent place in many scientific disciplines including cosmology, physics (phase transitions), chemistry (chemical reactions) and engineering (efficiency of energy conversion). <br/>This course introduces thermodynamic concepts, including energy, enthalpy, entropy, chemical potential, Gibbs and Helmholtz energy. On the basis of the First and Second Law of thermodynamics, the equilibrium concept will be introduced and used to describe reversible and irreversible processes. The Gibbs energy has a central role in this. Given the molar Gibbs energies of the reactants and products involved in a process, it can be deduced in what direction a process tends to go, what will be the maximum yield of a particular product and how the direction or yield for a process can be influenced by changing temperature, pressure and composition of a system. In addition to Introductory Thermodynamics A this course also introduces the mathematics of functions of several variables (total derivative, partial derivatives, etc).

In current agriculture, however, consumer-driven quality traits, such as flavour  colour and nutritional value have become increasingly important and the same holds for the production of specific plant compounds which can be used as sources for bio-based applications. Breeding for Quality is directed at improving whole fruit/vegetable characteristics and plant compounds, where flavour, colour, texture, absence of antinutritional factors or allergens, and shelf-life are important breeding objectives. Breeding for Quality also comprises the efficient production of all kinds of compounds, which are used as ingredients by the food, pharmaceutical, chemical, textile, paper, etc. industries. Examples of such compounds are: carbohydrates (starch, fructans, cellulose), proteins (wheat gluten, pea storage proteins), vegetable fats/oils (rape seed oil, cocoa fat), and secondary metabolites like flavours, fragrances, and phytoestrogenic molecules. In breeding programs, the existing genetic variation is exploited to increase the yield of (or enrich mixtures in) the target compounds. For this, it is necessary to understand the metabolic routes leading to the synthesis of the desired compound, and to have knowledge on how these compounds can be determined in the plant material.</p>",

  "The last century agriculture has been characterised by control and specialization: monocrops being grown with intensive use of fertilizers and pesticides. But environmental concerns, disease and pest resistance to pesticides and finite availability of resources call for a change in strategy. Diversity both in terms of utilizing different crop species and in combining different ecology-based management practices may provide an alternative. Yet, the mechanisms that drive the relationship between species  diversity and functioning ecosystem functioning and how this in combination with diversity in crop management can be used to create productive, resource-efficient and resilient crop systems  remains poorly understood. This course focusses on this knowledge gap.\r<br/>The first part of the course deals with what we can learn from natural systems, and analyzes the mechanisms that drive relationship between diversity and ecosystem functioning. The focus will be on resource sharing between neighbouring plants, and this will be addressed in an assignment containing both modelling and measurements on plants in the greenhouse.\r<br/>The second part addresses how this knowledge about effects of species diversity can be utilized in agricultural systems, looking at resource sharing between different species in a mixed cropping situation. Also here an assignment will be done that contains both modelling and plant measurements, aiming at the exploration of option to optimize mixed crop performance.\r<br/>Finally, the third part focuses on diversity in management options in the suppression of weed growth, taking into account the interaction between crop and weed plants and how this plays a role in integrated weed management (weed control through a combination of methods extending beyond herbicide use). Similarly, this will include both modelling and plant measurements.\r<br/>The complexity of the questions addressed above cannot be answered by experiments alone and expertise with computer simulations models has become an indispensable tool for researchers in this field. This course therefore has a heavy modelling component. Simulation models will be used for the analysis of plant-plant interaction and the consequences of management decisions. Therefore, during the course, you will be taught the principles of both functional-structural plant modelling using the modelling platform GroIMP, as well as mechanistic modelling of crop-weed interactions, using the modelling platform FST.",

  "This course offers an introduction to academic (source-based) research In the field of expertise of International Relations in historical perspective.\nFirstly, this concerns research design: the conceptualization and planning of a research project with an original, academically sound research question an a well-defined method to select and study the relevant primary and secondary sources. Learning this prepares you for the research for and writing of a BA Thesis in your third year.\nSecondly, it concerns a thorough introduction to research based on primary sources. After all, the ability to find, study and critically evaluate both primary and secondary sources and to use them effectively are crucial skills for any historian. You will not only study archive collections in an archive institution, but also learn how to work with digital sources and historical databases. You will also learn how to use and analyse non-textual sources such as artefacts and interviews, and photos, films and other multimedia resources. Furthermore, you will learn how to link different types of sources to relevant research methods, as well as how to document and manage the research data which you derive from these diverse resources. Finally, you will work actively on the link between sources and research questions and learn how to embed your research in broader academic debates.\nThirdly, it concerns knowledge transfer: students will learn how the results of their research can be made to have a societal impact and find audiences outside of academia.\nTo give you a frame of reference, the course offers a number of introductory lectures on the theoretical foundations and history of the field of expertise of International Relations in historical perspective. Through the combination of practical source analysis and theorizing you’ll learn to sort, describe and analyse different types of sources, put them in the context of academic debate and use them in your own research project. This will equip you with the research skills required to carry out research in the field of International Relations in historical perspective.",

  "To concern oneself with history is to concern oneself with writing. Clio, the muse of historiography, is usually depicted with a quill, papyrus scrolls and other tools for recording history. Even today, writing forms a central part of historians' working lives. Whether they work as researchers or in the culture, education, public or private sectors, writing and assessing texts and transferring knowledge remain crucial skills for historians when they leave university as well. In this course, you will practice transferring knowledge, insights and opinions using a variety of writing genres, such as a review, encyclopaedia entry or opinion piece. Thanks to the intensive supervision and feedback of your lecturers and fellow students, this course will give you a better insight into the transfer of historical knowledge through writing, improve your writing style and increase your pleasure in writing!

  "The BSc thesis is a 12 credits course which offers student the opportunity to carry out an individual scientific research in the Soil, Water, Atmosphere domain. The students write a research proposal, carry out research, and present this research both written (thesis) and orally (symposium). The thesis is accompanied by an appendix discussing ethical aspects of the thesis topic (or a related issue).<br/><br/>Prior to the start of the course an introduction lecture will outline the course content and goals. After this lecture, students can indicate their preferred topic from a list of available topics. Based on the student preferences, the coordinators will assign topics to the students. The student and supervisor should agree on the research proposal (maximum 2 pages A4; suggested workload 1.5 credits), and submit it together with the BSc thesis contract to the BSc coordinator. He will evaluate the proposal (go / no-go), and provide feedback to student and supervisor. Parallel to this, lectures will be given on thesis writing skills, oral presentation skills (including propositions), and ethics. Students are advised to follow these courses.<br/><br/>The nature of the BSc thesis research may greatly vary, depending on the topic and the research group. In some cases, a small experiment or fieldwork will be carried out by the student, to gather new data that will be used. In many cases, students will work with existing datasets (e.g. time series, spatial data) that may need to be compiled and/or modified to allow the analyses of interest. Students will analyze the dataset, choosing appropriate methods and software to do so. Building on this analysis, they should come up with original solutions and answers to the research questions and suggestions for further research. The suggested total workload of the research is 5 credits; supervisors will mark the research skills of the students based on the thesis assessment form.<br/><br/>Students will prepare a thesis describing their research. The suggested total workload of writing the thesis is 3 credits. The thesis report is marked by the supervisor, who will judge the contents (as outlined above), as well as scientific reporting aspects (writing). The thesis should be accompanied by an ethics appendix, which discusses ethical aspects of the research topic. The suggested workload for attending the ethics lectures and preparing the ethics appendix is 1.5 credits. The ethics appendix is marked by the ethics lecturer; the supervisor is encouraged to provide feedback on the ethics appendix, but will not evaluate it. The BSc thesis research is presented orally at the BSc symposium. Students present their work, including a brief introduction on the topic, the methods used, results obtained, and the conclusions reached. In addition, students formulate three propositions related to their research topic, and defend these. Guidelines for propositions are provided separately. The performance at the symposium will be marked by the domain-coordinators, in some cases assisted by other lecturers.",

Belangrijke antwoorden op westerse, seculiere ideeën passeren de revue, o.m. in de vorm van het antikolonialisme, het hervormingsgeoriënteerde liberalisme, revolutionair-islamitische ideologieën, en het ‘derde weg’-centrisme;\n3. Christelijk-islamitische relaties in het moderne Midden-Oosten. Op een overzicht van de verschillende christelijke gemeenschappen in de regio (Maronieten, Grieks-orthodoxe, Kopten, e.a.m.) volgt een module over de geschiedenis van de (westerse) christelijke missie in het Midden-Oosten, de rol van door missionarissen gestichte scholen en universiteiten, en de vorming van nieuwe ‘united’ christelijke kerken;\n4. Joods-islamitische relaties. Na de geschiedenis en kenmerken van de joodse gemeenschappen in het Midden-Oosten te hebben bestudeerd wordt ingezoomd op religie in het huidige Israël en op de religieuze aspecten van het Palestijns-Israelisch conflict.",

  "Modern biology routinely generates huge amounts of data: sequences, from NGS experiments; quantitative data, from -omics experiments; and graphs, representing molecular interactions. At the heart of many bioinformatics applications are algorithms that handle such types of data in time- and memory-efficient ways. Almost invariably these algorithms optimize some criterion - e.g. alignment quality, energy function or probability measure - using the data available.\r<br/>In this course, the main types of algorithms will be discussed, aiming to gain a deeper understanding of the computational strategies underlying these algorithms. This will allow students to recognize which type of algorithm will be applicable in the development of new bioinformatics tools to help answer new questions in (computational) biology.",

  "As the first in the MSc Programme Urban Environmental Management, this course introduces the four core perspectives in the Programme, i.e. Urban Environmental Quality and Health, Urban Environmental Technology, Urban Governance, and Urban Planning. The key concept in the course is that of a circular urban metabolism, which forms a basis for sustainable management of urban resources. Within a circular urban metabolism, resources necessary to support urban living are provided from renewable sources. Concepts such as Biomimicry, Cradle-to-Cradle, Industrial Ecology and Urban Harvest, with which the urban metabolism can be described, analysed and evaluated, are introduced. This is further extended by approaches (Urban Harvest Approach and The Natural Step), and tools such as Ecological Footprint, Mass Flow Analysis, Life Cycle Analysis and DPSIR. In addition to the consideration of urban resources the course provides a basic understanding of environmental quality of (urban) water, energy, waste, air, agriculture and services, its history and natural cycles and relevant indicators used to monitor it.<br/><br/>The course includes three excursions. Furthermore, students apply knowledge gained during the course in an individual assignment.

The periods mentioned are the periods of Wageningen University.<br/><br/>This course deals with interplay between tourism development and regional planning. It will acquaint students with the theories, methods and practices of tourism development and planning. It will addresses the tools for analysing the particularities of the context, methods and strategies for involving various stakeholders, and the instruments through which policies and practices influence the region and its development, and how these can be coordinated. This includes the formulation of policies and plans, different kinds of partnerships, communication strategies and place branding strategies. In this course we address these by studying theory, methods and approaches as well as reflecting on the role of planning and planners in concrete examples of tourism development situated in developing countries and western democracies. In addition students practice and apply contemporary and more classic insights from planning literature in a regional tourism case.</p>",

  "<p>The main objectives of this course are 1) to provide an overview of the state of the art in the fields of forest ecology and forest management, and 2) how we can integrate the two fields as a basis for sustainable forest management for the provisioning of forest resources and other ecosystem services (e.g., carbon sequestration, biodiversity conservation). Sustainable forest management requires a sound knowledge of the environment and ecological functioning of the forest. Through the application of management treatments, one can  intervene in the natural dynamics of the forest and guide the forest into a predefined, direction (management goal). In the course we will use examples from temperate and tropical forests.<br/>The course consists of four elements: lectures on forest ecology; lectures on forest management, field excursions, and a practical, in which you spend a considerable time in the forest. <br/>The course starts with lectures on forest ecology. We first discuss environmental conditions such as soil type and resource availability (light, water and nutrients), and how these abiotic factors vary in space and time. We then evaluate the causes and mechanisms of forest succession by focusing on: 1) disturbances that determine the availability of open sites, and how species differ in 2) availability, and 3) performance. This provides an ideal framework to understand forest functioning, and how management interventions can affect forest regeneration and dynamics and steer succession. The lectures on forest management will increase your understanding and knowledge about the effects of a variety of management practices, such as thinning, on ecological processes. A close link will be made with forest ecology discussed earlier. Additionally, we will explain the underlying mechanisms and processes of some of the major silvicultural systems in temperate and tropical forests. Three excursions will be made to Dutch forest sites to clarify and illustrate ecological concepts in the field. The course will be completed with a three weeks practical in which you design a silvicultural system for a Dutch forest based on specific objectives and using the ecological knowledge obtained during the course. A forest inventory is part of this practical.</p>",

  "<p>Nutritional status is determined by a complex  interaction between food intake and the use of nutrients by the body on the one hand, and susceptibility (either inborn or acquired) on the other hand. Both food intake and acquired susceptibility are influenced by lifestyle factors, socioeconomic and cultural circumstances.  Nutritional assessment is the interpretation of information of anthropometric, biochemical, clinical, dietary, and exercise data to determine nutritional status (from under- to over nutrition) in subjects and populations. To make a proper assessment of nutritional status you need to understand how this can be determined. Therefore, this course focuses on methodology that is used to obtain anthropometric and body composition data, energy expenditure &amp; physical activity data, and information on biomarkers of status and intake. The choice and application of assessment methods, and their advantages and disadvantages when studying a certain research question is addressed during this course.

  "Policy making can be described as a process that tends to involve different types of actors. Government organisations; stake holding groups such as 'local' people and interest groups such as those of farmers or industrialists; social movement organisations such as environmental organisations; the media; experts; the broader public -  all these take part in the interaction that leads to policy. Policy making also involves different forms of interaction between these different types of actors. Think, for example, of opinion polling, politicians' interactions with the public through television and the internet, interactive policy making and participatory approaches in development. This course charts the nature and significance of these interactions, thereby showing how policy making processes are situated in society and involve a series of elementary questions and dilemmas that policy makers need to address in their work. In this course we address these by studying theory as well as concrete examples situated in developing countries as well as western democracies. We compare approaches and see how they apply in different contexts - and also discuss how better communication can contribute to better policy.",

During the Thesis Path students acquire additional (study and research) skills with respect to the development of their own social science research project (thesis), including literature search and use, reading and writing, and the (philosophical) basis for social science and interdisciplinary research. During the 5th and 6th period of the 1st year of the course students go through the successive stages of proposal writing: identification of a research theme, and development of a research problem, scientific positioning (in relation to disciplinary debates around the theme of research and in relation to differences in the natural-social science field),  understanding the role of theory and the development of an appropriate conceptual framework, the formulation of appropriate research questions, and the link to methodology. The application of these steps is reflected in the development of a 2-page concept note. At the end of the 1st year or beginning of the 2nd year the students present their research proposal. After their field work, they present their (preliminary) results. Fellow students reflect on the presentation skills and provide input on the research plan and results.",

  "The health sector is faced with enormous challenges, including the increasing demand (e.g. due to an increase in chronic diseases), demographic changes (e.g. aging population), technological possibilities, increasing costs and decreasing budgets. Despite all of this, how healthcare is delivered has not changed much in 100 years. The pressure on healthcare providers to come up with sustainable and innovative solutions is huge. For example, the introduction of novel technologies (e-health) has changed the traditional patient-provider interactions within the clinic to more outpatient treatments and care facilities. At the same time, it has been more often than ever recognized that within health care facilities, quality of care is not just simply resulting from the treatment but ostensibly small details in the care environment can have major influences on treatment outcomes and quality of care (e.g., coloring of hospital walls influences perceptions of care). This is also sometimes referred to as the healing environment.<br/>Students are first introduced to the principles of management and organization and the strategic choices that healthcare providers can make. Central to this is dealing with the complexity and dynamics of the healthcare market, which moves in the tension of many different stakeholders (government, healthcare providers, consumers, pharmaceutical, insurance, interest groups). Then, students are familiarized with developments and the why and how of innovations in the health sector. The concept of innovation will be discussed, but also its approaches moving around consumer focus, technology and new business models. Finally, students learn which personal, contextual and persuasive factors influence individuals’ use of e-health interventions.

  "The amount of water used for human activities has rapidly increased over the last centuries. To increase human water use and to prevent floods, the natural water systems have been modified in large parts of the world. These increased human pressures have reduced or exceeded the carrying capacity of water systems. Future climate change and socio-economic development is expected to aggravate this. How future developments and climate change will affect water systems however is highly uncertain. To improve future water management we need to better understand interactions between climate change, human interventions and water system functioning and we have to manage our systems taking a more flexible and adaptive approach. This course aims at teaching the main theories, methods and approaches of adaptation of water systems to future pressures. <br>\r<br/>During the course the students will learn about climate change scenarios and the impacts of climate change on water resources, flood risks and water management. We will discuss how socio-economic changes affect water systems, water demand, and land use. Based on this information the students will learn how to develop scenarios and how to do a vulnerability assessment. <br>\r<br/>The course will also address different approaches of climate change adaptation in the water sector and possible adaptation tools. Future changes however are highly uncertain so during the course we will address and discuss which methods are available to develop strategies which take into account the uncertainties.<br>\r<br/>We will discuss examples from both the developed and developing world and we will address issues such as water scarcity, salt water intrusion, pollution and changing flood risks. <br>\r<br/>During the course students will develop an adaptive water management plan for a (sub)-basin or delta.

  "In the lectures, an overview will be given of the origin, evolution, diversity and adaptive radiation of the vertebrates. The course presents material on the macroscopical and microscopical level, using an integrative approach. Basic biomechanics is used to gain insight into the physical constraints on morphology. Specific topics (such as interpretation of the fossil record, comparative morphology at the levels of the organism, organs and tissues) are studied by the students from books and papers. Students discuss these topics in small groups on the basis of a series of questions. The laboratory work (14 half-days) provides a broad overview of the structural biology of the various lineages of vertebrates. The student will be trained to recognize the relationships between structure, function, behavior and environment. In one part (6 half days) major body plans will be studied via dissection. Another part (6 half days) focuses on the microscopical anatomy in relation to functional requirements. Macroscopical and microscopical requirements will be linked. In a third part (3 half days), students will work in small groups on a mini-research project. Each group studies a different aspect of the functional morphology of bird flight, such as wing and muscle design in relation to the specific requirements of flight.

European integration implies that the members of the EU give up parts of their sovereignty in pursuit of shared goals. This course gives an overview of selected aspects of this integration process, its challenges and effects. Policies which are an integral part of the integration process of the EU are in the centre of the course. Further EU policies relevant for the green economy such as the ones for environment, regional development and food safety are discussed as well. The course focuses on the formation of policies for agriculture, trade and regions of the EU and the assessment of their economic effects. The course provides a combination of economic as well as political science perspectives on a range of policy fields. <br/>The course consists of several parts. First, EU integration and EU policy making are introduced. Second, tools from micro economics (e.g. welfare analysis) and political science (e.g. content analysis) used for policy analysis are explained and practiced. Third, details of the institutions of the EU, its policy instruments and the underlying political and economic rationales are provided. The fourth part gives an overview of EU policies for agriculture, food, regions and trade as these domains are of key importance for European integration. They constitute a large part of the EU budget and they are vital for the Union’s future. Special attention will be paid to the different sectorial policies such as the Common Agricultural Policy and its effects on various stakeholders. Finally, attention is paid to EU trade policies with the rest of the world such as international trade liberalisation, non-tariff trade barriers and regional trade agreements. <br/></p>",

  "<p>A coordination mechanism is a subsystem of the social system that coordinates the activities of the persons or organizations within it. Wherever a relation exists between two or more persons or organizations, their activities require coordination in some form. The focus of this course is on the study of coordination problems and solutions to overcome them. Examples of coordination problems / solutions include: the management of interdependent activities (such as the vertical stages of production in agro-food chains); providing the right incentives in contracts; preventing depletion of natural resources due to overuse and the provision of public goods like landscapes and biodiversity. The characterizing feature of such problems is that cooperation between individuals would lead to efficient outcomes, but that deviating from the efficient cooperative outcome may be rational for individuals in cases of asymmetric information or uncertainty. As a result, transactions may not be undertaken and economic growth and the provision of public goods can be hampered. Our interest lies with the structure and features of organizational solutions (such as contracts and mergers) that mitigate such economic coordination problems. Content-wise the course will build on the concepts and theories that were introduced in the course aep-20806 (Institutional Economics and Economic Organization Theory).

The more diffuse cumulative global changes are exemplified by widespread problems, such as groundwater depletion, deforestation, and species extinction.<br/>In this broad and introductory course, which is compulsory for MSc students of the MSc programme Climate Studies, students will be introduced into many aspects of global change from a multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary perspective and with a specific focus on climate change. Physical, biological, social and economic issues will be discussed. The main topics of the six weeks are: introduction, drivers, modelling and scenarios, impacts, assessments and policy options. Most lectures will focus on general themes that set the scene and are relevant worldwide, while some lectures will provide examples from specific regions and countries.<br/>The course should be used by students as a frame of reference in future studies as it makes them aware of the society and policy implications of natural and socio-economic processes that are involved in these changes. <br/></p>",

  "<p>Please note that this course is offered at the Amsterdam Institute for Advanced Metropolitan Solutions in Amsterdam. Students who are not studying the master MMD but who would like to participate in this course should contact the course coordinator prior to registration.<br/><br/>In this course, students put their acquired skills into practice for the first time. In multidisciplinary themes they work on an AMS themed issue in a metropolitan region commissioned by a client from the private or public sector. Based on the briefing and terms of reference (TOR) received from the client, students develop a consultancy or project plan, including a preliminary problem definition and analysis and a plan for data generation and analysis. This leads to the 'Metropolitan Solution', a socio-technical design-related project and/or strategy in response to a clients request. The course builds on the courses Metropolitan Challenges and Metropolitan Innovators: The solution operates within the larger metropolitan system, while interrelating actors and entities. An applied training course (follow up of skills learning processes) in project management and leadership, scenario planning, innovation management, group dynamics and teamwork, multi-actor settings and intercultural communication is offered. In some cases, lectures will prove students with additional background information to tackle the issue at play in their case. Every student is expected to contribute his / her own knowledge and expertise to the group assignment and to reflect on this. <br/>Assignment examples: How to direct tourist movements in cities? How to make a football stadium sustainable? How to harvest nutrients from household waste in a neighbourhood? Where to produce biofuel in the city?

  "<p>Note: This course can not be combined in an individual programme with HNH-24806 Introduction to epidemiology and public health.<br/></p><p>The course teaches you the basic concepts, measures and study designs of descriptive epidemiology and public health. Descriptive studies investigate when, where and among whom health and disease in certain populations occur. Results of these studies can be used by policy makers in the field of public health. Different epidemiological and public health measures are introduced to describe health, disease and mortality. You will learn when to use these measures and how to calculate them. In addition, you are introduced to some major diseases, including infectious diseases, diabetes mellitus, cancer, and cardiovascular diseases. <br/>As a (nutritional) epidemiologist you need to know where to find valid data on disease occurrence (prevalence and incidence) world-wide. This will give you insight into differences between countries or regions. However, even data from reliable sources need to be interpreted with caution. Therefore in this course we have series of online discussion exercises that focus on a few diseases which are important world-wide and useful to illustrate epidemiological principles: diabetes &amp; cancer.

Vaak worden die met de term 'gouden eeuw' aangeduid. In de Lage Landen beleefde Brabant in de zestiende eeuw zo’n gouden eeuw en Holland overkwam in de zeventiende eeuw hetzelfde. Volgens sommigen was die van Holland gewoon een voortzetting van Brabants gouden eeuw, doordat Antwerpse kunstenaars naar het Noorden verhuisden.

The major actors in and around the production chain - producers, consumers, and government authorities possess different degrees of control. Legal relationships in the production chain are primarily determined by producers and consumers. The government mainly plays a facilitating role by providing contract law and business law. These dimensions of law show how a consumer oriented production chain is legally structured. Aside from playing a facilitating role, nationally and internationally governing authorities also have a steering role by means of legal instruments. In the public interest, the government restricts the freedom of producers and consumers by including mandatory provisions in private law and by enacting statutory rules in public law.

  "The course highlights three related areas of science relevant to development and healthy aging (or maybe better: aging healthy), corresponding to the expertise of the chair groups involved. We start with an introduction and some background. Then one case, the Dutch Famine will be discussed from different angle, which nicely illustrates the interrelationship between development and healthy aging. Then we focus on embryonic development and early life programming. In the second week we focus on aging healthy by gaining cellular and molecular knowledge about (muscle) mitochondrial functions, metabolic health and energy metabolism in relation to aging, with lectures and practicals. Finally, the third week is focussed on another important aspect of aging healthy, which is immunology and immunomodulation in relation to aging, again with lectures and practicals.",

  "This course builds on the enzymatic aspects that have been discussed in the course Food Chemistry (FCH-20806). A pivotal aspect is to select the right enzyme from a large number of enzymes available in nature in order to control an enzymatic process. Such a process can be designed for food production as well as for biorefinery of an agricultural raw material. The complexity of the raw material matrix and the properties of the enzyme (pH and temperature optimum, reaction products etc.) have to be accounted for. It is important to remember, understand and apply general biochemical principles. Moreover, it is important to extrapolate this knowledge to distinguish and select enzymes that play a role during food processing and biorefining. Exogenous enzymes that are added to a food, as well as endogenous enzymes that are present in a raw material are being discussed. Catalytic mechanism, structure-function relations, mode of action under changing conditions, as well as enzyme kinetics will be extensively dealt with. During the tutorial a case will be studied, using enzyme databases from the Internet. In the laboratory class the knowledge will be applied to design and evaluate an experiment including enzymatic conversions relevant for food processing and biorefinery.",

  "<p>This course is part of the Master MSc program Management, Economics and Consumer Studies and aims to provide opportunities to students to acquire and practice interdisciplinary skills. Students will learn by doing in a simulation and in group work on a cross-cutting theme in the area of food and sustainability. In an initial joint track of the course, students will be introduced to social science and natural science perspectives on this theme, and to the opportunities and challenges of addressing it in an interdisciplinary way. Knowledge on these topics is tested through a self assessment. In the group work, students from consumer studies, business studies, or economics and governance with support of natural scientists will design their own interdisciplinary research proposal on a topic of choice within the theme of nanotechnology and food and packaging. Expert-lecturers and coaches support the work in small groups, and they will assess the proposal from a social science, natural science and interdisciplinary viewpoint. The final joint track brings the whole group back together in a second round of the simluation and a reflection-lecture.

  "<p>Advanced biobased production systems are expected to provide society with food, fuel and biomaterials in de post-fossil fuel era. These production systems combine product flows and waste flows from plant and animal production together with novel bioprocessing technologies. Testing such novel concepts by building pilot plants is usually too expensive. The same holds for evaluation of modifications to existing production systems. Therefore, mathematical models can be a powerful tool to predict the performance and behaviour of the novel systems.<br/></p><p>In view of the above, this course discusses how to develop mathematical models using the System Dynamics approach. This approach is often used to simulate complex models with non-linear behaviour. To learn this approach, students work with a partner on computer practical cases. The cases consist of a complex farming system divided into sub-systems.<br/>In this course, students learn to analyse critically mathematical models available in literature, in order to reproduce and connect them to perform system-level simulations. These simulations are oriented towards answering specific research questions.<br/>The course covers different tools for model implementation. First, models are represented in Forrester diagrams, common in System Dynamics. These diagrams are then implemented in a graphical simulator. Finally, models are coded into a programming language. <br/>Students are guided through common steps in the development of mathematical models, with a focus on complex biosystems: formulating research questions, gathering data and models from literature, writing and solving differential equations, sensitivity analysis, model calibration, model validation, and uncertainty analysis.<br/><br/>This course is the first course in the MSc Biosystems Engineering. The course includes an orientation on the study domain with a multiple-day field trip to relevant organizations, universities and industries in the Netherlands and surrounding countries.

Both field will be covered in the course. \r<br/>In the economics of health attention is paid to the demand for health and the production of health, both at the individual (household) and the societal level. The human capital theory will be discussed, just as social and public health approaches that pay attention to the social benefits of health and illness. \r<br/>In the economics of health care at least three sub-fields can be discerned: the market of health care, health care systems and policies and economic evaluation. \r<br/>The market of health care starts with a description of demand and supply in the health care industry, which has some peculiarities. The understanding of markets, market failure and the role of government in health care is very important in the health care sector. Various theories, like principal agent theory and new institutional economics will be used to analyse problems in this field e.g.  supplier-induced demand,  rationing methods from a consumer's perspective,\r<br/>Health insurance- the role of private and social insurance- and health care financing deserves special attention and leads to various health care systems and policies and forms of regulation. \r<br/>Economic evaluation consist of methods that can be used to establish the benefits, cost, efficiency and equity of health care interventions. Attention will be paid to issues and problems of cost benefit (CBA) and cost-utility(CUA) analysis.",

In doing so, we touch on strategies such as advisory communication, persuasion, participatory innovation development, citizen science and the facilitation of societal learning and conflict management. These communicative intervention strategies are linked to insights about 'why people do what they do' and 'say what they say', and also to the potential of specific communication methods and media.

  "The field of health is dynamic and complex. Health is influenced by a diversity of interconnected factors, and different sectors and actors are involved. As a consequence, the development of public health policy is essential and organisations and professionals have to collaborate in the provision of care, prevention and health promotion.\r<br/>In this course we review the influence of global, national and local health policies on the organisation of public health systems. For instance, policies of the World Health Organization (WHO) and European Union (EU) influence the organization of health systems on the national level. Likewise, national health policies determine local health policy and thereby local health systems. Decision-making during the development of health policies, depends on the actors involved and on the context in which the policy-making takes place. We take a closer look at health policy on the global, national and local level and discuss theories, decision-making models and tools in the field of health policy development and in network societies. We also unravel the policy-making process and address priority setting in health.\r<br/>The functioning of organisations and actors within the health field is strongly related to health policies. Public health and society professionals have an important role in promoting and protecting health. They collaborate with policy-makers, with professionals within the health care sector, professionals of other sectors and communities. We discuss theories and methods to set policy on the agenda, and to develop, implement and evaluate policy. We also study policy implementation from the perspective of specific stakeholders such as general practitioners, health promotion professionals and the public.\r<br/>In this course, students acquire more in-depth knowledge and competencies in the field of health and health promotion and are trained in program level learning outcomes of the Bachelor Health and Society. Program level learning outcomes addressed are: applying theoretical approaches, explain health policy making in the field of public health, choose and apply research methods, explain ethical issues that may arise when working in the field of public health, collaborate in a (multidisciplinary) team, communicate clearly (verbally and writing) and reflect upon personal knowledge, skills, attitudes and functioning.

  "<p>Environmental issues are societal issues as human activities result in environmental changes that have an unwanted impact on (parts of) society and its interaction with nature, and because solutions ask for significant adaptation in policy, social practices and in production-consumption systems. The analysis of the environmental changes, causes, beneficial and harmful impacts, and sustainable solutions requires the involvement and close cooperation of technological, natural and social sciences and various actors in society. However, cooperation and communication is not that simple as culture, language and methodologies substantially differ between the scientific disciplines and the actors.<br/>The course demonstrates how different scientific disciplines contribute to analyzing, solving and preventing environmental problems, and to creating long lasting and sustainable approaches. It builds on the courses that are given in the first year of the BSc Environmental Sciences. The animal consumption and production chain is the central theme as it is a topical matter with a lot of public debate, it links to many environmental issues (e.g. sustainability of food production, depletion of resources such as nutrients, water and energy carriers, pollution, climate and land use change, biodiversity loss) and Wageningen University has the leading scientists in all fields related to animal production.

The course runs throughout the entire MSc-programme, allowing students to form a community of learners that focus on the societal, environmental, ethical, legal, IPR and socio-economic aspects of plant biotechnology, taking the various technologies as a starting point. Essentially, three main issues will be leading: (1) what is possible within Plant Biotechnology (the technology), (2) what is allowed within Plant Biotechnology (concerning environmental safety regulations, for example) and (3) what will be accepted by society (the societal debate).\r<br/>- students will meet each other regularly to discuss current technologies and topics in plant biotechnology;\r<br/>- there will be discussions and debates on ethics and philosophical issues;\r<br/>- students will organize thematic evenings with Experts/ Guest speakers, who will present relevant topics and research innovations, open for discussion.\r<br/>The core of the course is formed by five evening sessions per academic year, which will be combined with individual and group activities to prepare, process, evaluate and reflect on these sessions. The evening sessions will be organized once every period (with periods 3 and 4 taken together as one period), on the 4th Tuesday of each period (and the 1st Tuesday of period 4).",

  "<p>Soft matter is the study of materials that are neither solid, nor liquid. They are somewhere in between. Examples of such materials can be found everywhere around us: food products, soaps, gels, paints, and almost all biological materials. Characteristic of these materials is that their structure and dynamics at the microscale are dominated by thermal fluctuations. In this course we will show how the balance between these thermal fluctuations and the interactions between molecules can lead to complex structures and mechanical properties at a larger scale. Topics include: thermal motion and diffusion, linear and non-linear mechanics, adhesion and friction, liquid interfaces, wetting, gels and virus assembly. Special attention will be paid to modern developments in soft matter research and to the relevance for practical areas such as food science and nanotechnology.  The course consists of lectures and an experimental research project, on a topic that is closely related to the research in the department. The research project is done in small groups of 2-4 students.</p>",

  "Landscape architects are increasingly involved in the design of urban environments such as housing, commercial and inner city improvements. With their knowledge about landscape processes and living materials, they can contribute to landscape and sustainability issues in the cities. They are able to respond to the unique context of the urban landscape. Often, in such projects, developers or municipalities define the building programme. The task for the landscape architect is to combine the programme with the various interactions in the landscape system. On the other hand, many future urban developments are hard to predict. Therefore, urban design interventions also need to be responsive to such uncertainties and the landscape architect needs to choose a suitable design procedure to address this issue. In this design studio the students work on a scale level of 1:5000 to 1:100 and face the complexities of landscape, urban functions, buildings and composition related to urban design.",

  "<p>Note: This course can not be combined in an individual programme with GRS-10306 Introduction Geoinformation Science.<br/></p><p>In spatial planning and landscape design the description and the communication of the human environment is largely based on visual expressions like maps, pictures and drawings. Due to technological and social developments of the last decennia these visual expressions are considerably replaced by representations using digital concepts and techniques. Many of such representations are called geo-information: information about locations on Earth (where, what, when). As an example we may point at the internet spread of virtual globes, web maps and geotagged social media. These types of geo-information do have a serious impact on the practices of planning and design. <br/>To help you to understand such impact the course introduces terms, concepts and methods of geo-information science (GIS) that underpin these digital representations. Terms, concepts and methods are related to collecting, handling and visualizing geo data. Besides the course offers you a first glimpse on the next generation geo data like volunteered geo-data, geo-social data, LIDAR, and 3D data.

  "This course provides an introduction to the dynamics of development processes, with a strong focus on agriculture, food and rural areas. This course also pays ample attention to the relations between agrarian and rural development on the one hand and urban development on the other. The course follows a comparative approach. By means of cases studies from  'developed' countries (i.e. Europe and North America) as well as from 'developing' countries (Africa, Asia and Latin America) the sociological and anthropological aspects of agricultural and rural development processes are analysed. As such students get acquainted with the most important theories and analytical concepts with which these processes can be understood.",

  "Worldwide social transformation processes, related to livelihoods, agro-food networks and the environment take place in both national and international contexts. Such processes involve changes at different levels. Change is generally discussed in terms of 'what should be done'. In this course we try to understand change and change management by analyzing how people actually communicate when they are confronted with new developments. Starting from a complexity approach, with a focus on inclusion and exclusion processes, we will analyze inter-human processes, as they emerge in interpersonal communication. Resistance to change, for instance, will be discussed with special attention for social identity issues such as group-think, the role of honor and shame and the importance of face-saving. These factors, although in different appearances depending on specific situations and cultures, are often decisive factors in change processes. Related to conflict and negotiation for change we will analyze how people construct frames while communicating, including the goals they pursue in specific interaction contexts and the effect of frames and framing. There will be special attention for self-organization in networks, based on direct interaction between people, resulting in planned and unplanned change. Finally, we will pay attention to the role of storytelling and conversations for social change and transformation.",

  "Technological changes are often at the core of development projects and societal controversies. Examples include biofuels, transgenic crops, land redistribution, pesticides, microcredits, and the introduction of novel information technologies. This course deals with theories and concrete situations in which social justice issues are intertwined with technological change. The course offers frameworks to analyse inequality, poverty, power in social transformations, and representations of injustice. The framework for this social analysis of technological change is interdisciplinary as it uses selected notions from political philosophy, science and technology studies, development studies, sociology and anthropology.<br/>This course introduces key concepts of social justice theories and contains exercises to work with these concepts. We will discuss how development studies can be framed in social justice terms. The technologies that are used as cases include both social engineering technologies (such as land reform or standards) as well as new, complex artefacts, such as transgenic crops. Later parts of the course address political ecology, Indigenous knowledge, and the practical prospects of governing innovation and technology on a global scale.",

  "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Advancements in technology and information processing are rapidly changing many fields of plant sciences, animal sciences and ecology, including research, agriculture and conservation. For example, distributed sensor networks currently allow for the acquisition of huge volumes of data on many relevant aspects, ranging from soil and vegetation characteristics, abiotic conditions like weather, to the behaviour of animals. The availability of unprecedented amounts of data is unlocking potential, however, it also creates a major challenge: the ability to effectively process and analyse it. In the current data-centered digital era that is driven by technological change, the volume of data will continue to skyrocket due to decreasing costs of data collection, storage and processing. Fostered by these technological developments, researchers and various branches of business are increasingly embracing <i>data science</i>: a concept to unify data processing, statistics, artificial intelligence and their related algorithms to extract knowledge from data. Hence, data science is increasingly becoming an integral part of decision making in many fields, including precision agriculture, livestock management and nature conservation, as it fosters automated prediction and classification (e.g.: is this animal ill?, is this plant a weed?, is this apple ready to pick?, when should we harvest?).</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">To keep up with these technological developments, students need to become acquainted with the terms, concepts and methodology accompanying these developments. This is especially important since it can require a different approach to using data and conducting science than the approaches they are familiar with. Namely, the large volumes of data usually come from various sources, each with their own characteristics, uncertainties and measurement errors. The data from these different sources need to be integrated, and the inherent heterogeneity should be accounted for. Moreover, the collected sensor data are generally not immediately fit for analyses, so that pre-processing of the raw data is needed. After initial data pre-processing, the engineering of informative and discriminating features (i.e., measurable properties of the phenomenon being observed) is a crucial step for creating effective algorithms. Furthermore, the collection of large volumes of data leads to a shift away from frequentist hypothesis testing towards analytics that is more focussed on prediction, classification, pattern recognition or anomaly detection. To this end, machine learning techniques are often used, usually by high performance computing.</p><p>This course covers the main elements of using a data science approach to solving agricultural or ecological problems. The students will be guided through the main concepts and skills that are required to become a successful data scientist working in ecology. These skills relate to three pillars of data science expertise: (1) mathematics and statistics; (2) computer science and programming; and (3) domain knowledge, i.e., the understanding of patterns and processes governing (agro-)ecological systems. Hence, this course builds upon, and expands, the understanding and skills generated in other courses, and focuses on combining these in an interdisciplinary way to be optimally able to solve (agro-) ecological problems with a data-driven approach. Approaches to solving common (agro-)ecological problems will be discussed, as well as the common problems to the associated data: the usually large degrees of spatial-temporal (auto)correlation and the non-independence between individuals. Methods to deal with these issues will be discussed, including algorithms that specifically account for these issues.</p><p>During the course, students will increase their knowledge and skills via hands-on experience where the taught principles and methods are put into practice. Using large datasets from current cutting-edge science projects (e.g., data gathered about animal behaviour via wearable sensors such as GPS and inertial measurement units, or data about vegetation via airborne or ground-based spectral sensors), different steps in the data science lifecycle will be covered and practiced: from problem definition; data management, cleaning and pre-processing; data exploration; feature engineering; selecting and training algorithms; optimizing hyperparameters; validating algorithms; testing predictions; to visualization and communication of results. The students will be trained to apply different machine learning techniques, and critically evaluate their merits. During the course, students will acquire and expand data science skills that will prepare them for a quantitative MSc thesis, and that will benefit their future career in academia or business.</p>",

  "Problems associated with food security and depletion of natural resources and the need for economically viable and socially acceptable systems are important reasons for a redesign of land use systems at the level of farms, as well as at the regional level. The QUALUS course deals with quantitative land evaluation and presents an overview of quantitative methods for regional and farm level land use analysis and design. The methods identify options for sustainable systems and land use and reveal trade-off among objectives. To use these methods, you need to apply disciplinary knowledge about economy, soil, climate, animals and plants. Important aspects of the various methods treated are their aim, spatial and temporal scale and climatic zone. One of the mathematical techniques for these model-based land use studies, i.e. linear programming is presented in more detail. Attention will be given to involvement of stakeholders and using scenarios. The course and its methods are illustrated with a comprehensive study.

This course aims to put this transformative process into historical context by comparing it with the rise of other mass media technologies and how they have shaped our modern world. Through this comparison students will learn to better understand and predict the consequences of the rise of the internet for modern culture.\nThis course considers mass media as cultural phenomena: books, newspapers, the telegraph, television or the internet are not just technologies, but also include historically specific practices and knowledge. There are many examples how different mass media have shaped modern culture and society: the invention of the printing press helped spread the ideas of the Reformation across Europe, the speed that the first transatlantic telegraph cable brought to communication between North America and Europe transformed the ideas of space and time, and the spread of TV had profound consequences for the way we write history: instead of the media reporting events of historical significance, we now have “media events” – highly orchestrated visual spectacles specifically designed for maximum exposure. However, the mass media have not only helped to spread the images, ideas, concepts and values that constitute modern culture (such as rationalism, nationalism and the idea of progress), but they are themselves important symbols of modernity: Gutenberg’s printing press and the telegraph, for example, were once seen as modern marvels ­– just like the iPhone, when it was introduced in 2007. \nIn this course, we will critically investigate the cultural impact of these mass media technologies and the way they have been represented throughout modern history, asking questions such as: who really used these technologies and how were they consumed? How are they constructed discursively through literature, laws, images, etc.? What happens to a society’s culture (its religious, political, cultural texts), when it is increasingly mediated by these technologies?",

  "One quarter of the global human population is suffering from a parasite infection. Similar or higher infection rates happen in domesticated animals, while the incidence of parasites in wild animals is largely unknown. Plants are equally vulnerable to infections with parasites.  Reductions of global food production by parasites such as nematodes aggregate to 15 percent or higher. Often food crops can no longer be grown in specific areas because of the local build-up of devastating soil-born parasites. This course teaches students the unique survival and reproduction strategies of parasites of animals and plants. Many parasites thrive in the host for several months or longer, while largely being untouched by the immune systems of the host.  These parasites manage to keep a fine balance between exploiting the host's resources and neutralizing its immune responses. The focus in this course is on current topics in host-parasite interactions, which includes advanced knowledge from other disciplines such as ecology, molecular and cell biology, plant and animal physiology, biotechnology, immunology, and genetics. Besides working towards a better understanding of host-parasite interactions as a biological phenomenon, we will also discuss how this knowledge can translate into better human and animal health, and more sustainable approaches to food safety and security.",

  "<p>Note: This course can not be combined in an individual programme with FEM-31806 Models for Ecological Systems.<br/></p><p>Systems approaches and quantitative simulation models are widely used in studies of ecological systems to increase understanding of ecosystems functioning and improving systems management. The application domain ranges from (sub-)individual level to (agro-) ecosystem level. Systems approaches represent a scientific concept in which the real world is divided into systems. These systems are captured into models, and studying model behaviour allows testing of hypotheses and increases knowledge.<br/>This course builds on courses such as EZO-23306 (Biology) and CSA-10806 (Plant Sciences). It is intended for 2nd or 3rd year students, in particular for biologists, agro-ecologists, crop protectionists and soil scientists, but the way of thinking and the simulation techniques presented are applicable in many fields of science.<br/>The course comprises four blocks:<br/>1. systems dynamics with examples from population ecology;<br/>2. model performance &amp; model evaluation;<br/>3. partial differential equations &amp; modelling in space;<br/>4. integrating case studies on population dynamics &amp; nutrient dynamics in soil.<br/>In the 1st block, concepts such as system, model, simulation, state, rate, feedback, time-coefficient, relational diagram, analysis of dimensions or units, and numerical integration methods are briefly refreshed, and presented along with examples from population ecology. The focus is on conceptual model formulation and quantitative model specification. Programming is done based on relational diagrams, using the software Visual Grind.<br/>The 2nd block focuses on model evaluation. Statistical means and inverse modelling are used to assess how well a model describes experimental data. Parameter values are estimated, sensitivity analysis performed and model outcomes critically discussed. Programming is done using Matlab, which gives more possibilities than Visual Grind.<br/>The 3rd block introduces partial differential equations for simulations in 1D and 2D. We start simulating heat flow, and mass flow and diffusion of nutrients in soils. Subsequently, several techniques for spatial modelling are studied. Examples include vegetation patterning, and dispersal by organisms, both at the individual and population level.<br/>In the 4th block 'integrating case studies' are set-up such that the cycle of systems analysis and programming, i.e. data - systems knowledge - conceptual and mathematical model - implementation in a program - parameter estimation - model testing - exploration of management options, is practiced.</p>",

  "In the latter half of the twentieth century, no conflict was as vivid in popular imagination in countries across the world as the Vietnam War. There are many reasons for this. The most powerful country in the world chose to fight a war that became ever more hopeless and devastating, which left an indelible mark on American confidence and the country's self-image. The war had profound consequences, not only for Vietnam and its neighbours, but also for international relations more generally, for American influence in the world and for domestic developments in the US. Even today, the Vietnam War is synonymous with the perils of overconfidence and foreign interference, and its traumatic legacy continues to be a significant factor shaping debates about interventions such as those in Iraq and Afghanistan.\nThis course offers a broad historical view of the Vietnam War. Alongside the conflict itself, it also considers the events leading up to the war, the Cold War context, how the war unfolded and ultimately ended, American decision-making, the long-term ramifications in the US, its cultural manifestation in American cinema, music and photography and the Vietnamese perspective. Diverse viewpoints will be analysed through a combination of lectures on specific themes and a broad selection of literature. The literature will be discussed in tutorials, as will documentaries about the Vietnam War. Three feature films round out the course. Students' knowledge will be assessed on the basis of an essay and a final exam.\nPlease note: The lectures of this course are in English.

Selection of a particular method is exemplified by real-world problems in air, soil and water chemistry, environmental chemistry, environmental technology, etc. (case-study).\r<br/>Tutorials related to the lecture topics help improving insight by answering questions and solving assignments (simple calculations).\r<br/>In the practical students determine different chemical forms of compounds (e.g. heavy metals, benzene) in groundwater, surface water, soil, and plant material with a variety of analytical techniques, such as: inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES), mass spectrometry (MS), gas chromatography and high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). The structure of unknown organic constituents is elucidated by means of mass spectroscopy (MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Free ions are analysed using specific metallic electrodes and with a specific separation method (DMT).

The various methods available are compared with respect to their field of application, limits of detection, selectivity, accuracy, precision, throughput and robustness.\r<br/>Groups of students (3-4) will work on a case-study reflecting real-life problems.

Video games, movies, novels, heritage tours, museums, policy papers on history education, and commemorative rituals illustrate how dealing with the past entails much more than professional historians’ textbooks. But who decides which past has to be preserved, commemorated and communicated in the public sphere? Today, the notion of shared authority typifies the heritage and memory arena. The historian or archaeologist is no longer the privileged steward of the past. Rather, a variety of people with different agendas and specific sets of cultural dispositions interpret, consume, and reproduce the past. This democratisation and diversification of history consumers and producers requires an interdisciplinary theoretical and methodological toolkit, enabling the historian to appropriately study, address, and engage these different audiences. By exploring key theoretical literature on public history and heritage, and exploring topical international case studies, you will familiarise yourself with the central debates that have structured contemporary discussions about heritage, memory and museums. You will train your research skills in the analysis of an example of the use of the past.\n \nDuring the first part of the course (week 1-4) students will read and discuss a selection of key texts on heritage, memory, historical museums, and public history. We will also discuss a topical case study in which these different conceptual issues are operationalised. In the second part of this",

  "<p>At Wageningen University several courses are focused on processes underlying the environmental impact of chemicals on human and environmental health (e.g. Environmental Toxicology (TOX30806), Chemical Stress Ecology and Risk Assessment (AEW30806)). Within these natural sciences- oriented courses, the existing regulations and the methods for the assessment of the environmental risks of chemicals and contaminants for human and environmental health are only touched upon. However, environmental risk assessment of chemicals is essential for safe use and application of products, for protecting the quality of our living environment for all species including man, as well as for taking decisions in subsequent risk management, risk communication and risk governance activities. Different regulatory frameworks exist to assess Environmental Risks of chemicals, each with specific focus, scientific underpinning and technical approaches (toolkits). Examples of such frameworks are REACH, Plant Protection Product and Biocide Directives of the EU, the Water Framework Directive of the EU and also the derivation of Environmental Quality Standards for soil, water and atmosphere. Environmental Quality Standards can be applied in site-specific risk assessments of chemicals, although alternative approaches are more and more demanded in order to achieve case- specific, tailor- made solutions.<br/>In order to comply with such different regulatory frameworks, there is a high demand for well-trained risk assessors, who have the conceptual synopsis of the different approaches and even more who have the scientific and technical knowledge and skills to design and conduct environmental risk assessments. This course, Environmental Risk Assessment of Chemicals (ERAC), is set up to meet this need and has therefore great societal urgency. It will provide students with the know-how and dexterity to perform risk assessments in different settings/roles, e.g. as a regulator, in an academic setting or as a consultancy advisor. Students will gain deep insight in 1) prospective environmental risk assessment, i.e. assessment of risks of chemicals prior to market authorisation and use, 2) retrospective environmental risk assessment, i.e. risks of chemicals after their use and environmental release, and 3) environmental risk assessment of legacy contaminants resulting from historic use and release and/or from natural sources (e.g. PCBs, dioxins and heavy metals). Differences and similarities between the different regulatory framework will be explained, and developments in the regulation of new emerging compounds will be covered. Students will learn to apply approaches and techniques within the different frameworks to real life examples.  A major theme in this course is how to deal with the uncertainty and limited availability of data for decision making in environmental risk assessment and how to ascertain that the majority of environmental species are adequately protected without the need for testing all of them. The concepts and approaches in environmental risk assessment will also be compared in a wider context with other risk assessment-frameworks especially those for food-related chemicals, which also include environmentally relevant regulated chemicals and contaminants.<br/>Risk assessment is an integration of natural sciences and social sciences. ERAC, with a primary focus on the technical concepts and skills needed in the different Risk assessment frameworks, will connect the more natural science-oriented courses on environmental impact of chemicals with the more social science- and policy-oriented courses on risk governance (ENP35806) and environmental economics (ENR21306). The target groups of the course are students of MES, MML, MEE, MAM, MBI.</p>",

The state is not only the most important organisation, exerting the greatest possible influence on social life, but it is also the arena in which different social groups compete for political power.\nNowadays, the state governs the life of its citizens from cradle to grave: it builds roads, provides healthcare and welfare support, regulates the economy, provides education, and protects the environment. This has not always been the case. How did the state actually acquire its power? And what has enabled states to become the dominant form of political organisation, replacing other political organisations such as cities and empires? How did the nation and the state become entangled? Did nationalism precede the emergence of states, or did the state instead breed nationalism?\nThis course answers such questions by providing an overview of the rise of the modern state.

  "This course provides critical knowledge of the natural and cultural processes that shape landscapes produced in historical and cultural geography and the related disciplines. In order to understand contemporary cultural landscapes and their heritage, this course specifically takes into account their historical genealogies together with their modern day material, symbolic and social uses and impacts. Key landscape-oriented concepts and approaches from a variety of scientific disciplines are introduced. A broad overview is offered of how past spatial practices, ideas, policies and technologies are embedded in present day landscapes. Besides that, the focus is on learning practical skills and methods to understand the history of landscapes and analyze how these may contribute to landscape architecture and planning in increasingly diverse societies with diverse demands. Attention will be given to developing debating skills pertaining to practical, political and ideological issues that confront people when coping with the historical legacy of landscapes in current design and planning interventions. Examples are drawn from the Netherlands, Europe and other parts of the world generally.<br/>The course will begin with a an historiographic overview of key concepts and approaches present in scientific disciplines related to landscape research. This entails a critical discussion of the theories and methods that form the backbone of this module, that of 'landscape'. We address how and why historical and cultural geographers are concerned with these landscapes and how knowledge and interpretation of its past is relevant for landscape architects and planners. After an introduction to the analysis of prehistoric, historic and early modern landscape formation processes, using a wide variety of sources, we gradually move towards modern landscapes. This part of the course introduces a selection of key concepts, methods and tools from cultural geography and the related disciplines and focuses on the interplay between landscapes and the processes of identity-formation, memory-construction and social change. The course includes two important practical components: a (written) assignment in which groups of students unravel the landscape history of a designated area near Wageningen, and a (smaller) assignment in which we practice debating skills and public speaking. Additionally, we will make excursions to an archive (Tiel or Arnhem), the Cultural Heritage Agency of the Netherlands (Amersfoort) and the areas that are central in the first assignment.",

  "Biological systems are characterized by connections between different components that together may lead to complex and highly dynamic behaviour. A main goal of systems biology is to translate these connections into models that describe and predict the activity of living organisms in their ecosystems. Systems biology depends on mathematical modelling approaches, in order to generate models that help to understand living systems, as well as to predict their future dynamics. Irrespective whether one considers molecular interaction networks or ecosystem level networks, the mathematical tools which are applied can be conceptualized with only small extensions of basic mathematical knowledge and are very similar - systems biology is independent of the level of biological organisation. In this course we will discuss elegant case-studies covering a careful selection of biological systems, showing how mathematical modeling has been applied to biological problems across very different scales, and how modeling is combined with experiments in the systems biology research cycle. The course builds on basic knowledge of students in both mathematics and modeling of biological systems, with emphasis on the integrated perspective of systems biology.  From the discussed examples, we will show that the same modeling approach can be used to investigate diverse biological problems at different organization levels, such as predator-prey interactions, multicellular pattern formation and microbial chemotaxis. During the course, students will apply different types of models to describe and predict processes at cellular, organism and ecosystems level.",

The programming languages dealt with during the course are R and python.\r<br/>Professionals in private companies and research institutes are increasingly using scripting languages for applied spatial analysis. We notice that students still have a kind of 'scripting' barrier to overcome. Some students are afraid of scripting and others stick very closely to the examples given. We like to relax this attitude. From the perspective of an advanced course we like to change the cookbook approach in favor of a more explorative approach. Becoming more relaxed towards scripting and a more explorative approach means that some generic scripting principles must be known to create a 'core' script. On the other hand students have to learn which libraries are available for spatial data analysis and visualization and how these libraries can be used within the 'core' script.",

  "<p>The study of law and regulation describes an interdisciplinary approach to regulatory phenomena using methodologies from a variety of sources. It investigates the context in which food law works. It looks at the regulation of the food chain from an external perspective, assessing options and reasons to regulate. Considerations include improving competitiveness of the food industry, efficient allocation of resources and promoting the effective functioning of the internal market, as well as food law as an incentive for economic action. Regulators and regulatees interact in the regulation of food supply chains. Actors in supply chains will respond to the perceived positive and negative managerial and financial consequences of the regulatory system. Stakeholders in food supply chains will consider legal requirements as a cost factor (i.e. costs of compliance, including administrative burdens) and possibly as a stimulus for improved food procurement through innovation, to overcome the legally created barriers. Since the end of the previous century the food regulatory system has been expanding dramatically due to the occurred safety problems in supply chains. However, compliance to the restrictive regulatory system to control risks will only be guaranteed if the expected benefits surpass the additional costs. Rule-makers on their side will include the decision making process of the addressed actors in the design of the systems as well as the expected consequences of non-compliance for consumers' health and safety.<br/>The course addresses the dynamic interaction between public and private regulation and follow-up by private actors. Subthemes that will be addressed include the economic considerations and effects of competition law, food labelling, pre-market approval &amp;  innovation, and the role of control by means of private food law.</p>",

Some speak of a post-truth era, in which personal convictions have become more important in the public domain than objective truth. How come that many people feel this way, and what do these developments mean for the ways in which science is communicated in society? The course focuses on master students who are interested in the public communication on science and technology. Experts and citizens often have different appreciations of science and technology. What is the nature of these differences and what are the implications? How do people deal with complex information regarding technological risks? What is the role of emotions?

These changes may significantly contribute to impaired quality of life and (or) disease burden. Increasing evidence indicates that next to intervention strategies directed towards the primary (disease-) process it makes sense to target these associated disorders. Combinations of nutritional and pharmacological intervention can often provide feasible and relevant strategies to improve a persons' health status or quality of life.\r<br/>During this course different aspects of metabolic changes that affect nutritional status, treatment-ability and outcome of the patient with chronic disease will be discussed. The focus will be on disease or treatment-induced loss of muscle mass and function. The course focuses on 1) inflammation as a general common inducer of muscle loss, 2)  tissues of inflammatory origin: adipose tissue, gut and tumour, 3) disease or treatment specific mechanisms (e.g. disease induced anorexia , hypoxia / ischemia  or ischemia/reperfusion induced muscle protein breakdown (COPD, cancer, heart failure, surgery)), 4) how interaction between the sources of inflammation can enhance the effect. 5) Moreover, the metabolism linking inflammation-induced muscle loss and patient outcome (infectious complications and drug toxicities) will be discussed in depth as well as 6) current evidence on multi-target treatment interventions in this process with nutrition, pharma or exercise and 7) the knowledge gap that is still there on treatment of muscle wasting that is crucial to be filled in, to be able to interfere.",

De belangrijkste gebeurtenissen en ontwikkelingen op politiek, economisch, sociaal en religieus-cultureel gebied zullen hierbij de revue passeren.

De komst van het christendom is eveneens een zeer ingrijpende, en voor de geschiedenis van Europa bepalende, ontwikkeling geweest. In later eeuwen gaat het om het ontstaan van universiteiten, de geweldige uitbouw en bloei van de economie met grote ontginningen, de vorming van het cultuurlandschap, handelsexpedities, ontdekkingsreizen, demografische groei en de urbanisatie van delen van Europa; daarnaast zijn er staatkundige ontwikkelingen, variërend van de opkomst van Statenvergaderingen en de langzame groei die het gezag van koningen en heersers doormaakt, tot opstanden en oorlogen. Op religieus en cultureel gebied spelen onder andere de grote concilies, maar ook de gregoriaanse hervorming, de investituurstrijd en de zogenoemde Renaissance van de twaalfde eeuw.

  "Knowledge of and capability to work with sustainability concepts, indicators and issues belong to the core competences to be obtained in the environmental sciences. Sustainability is a concept that can be linked to many domains in society. This course is tailored towards two of the major domains: water and energy systems. Energy and water systems are crucial for human subsistence and of major environmental relevance. This course deals with the major transformations (transitions) that are needed within water and energy systems to reach sustainability. The course entails concepts of sustainability and transitions, applied to water and energy production, supply, distribution and consumption. It presents indicators for the assessment of long-term strategies towards sustainable water and energy systems and shows and discusses historical and present issues in energy and water technology and management in the Netherlands.<br/>In this course the concept transition is used as a whole of transformation processes in which sectors in society change in a fundamental way over one generation (25 years) or more. Apart from discussing future transitions in water and energy, special attention will be given to the major changes water and energy systems have undergone in the past.<br/>The course includes theoretical literature and lectures on sustainability and transition (management), indicators for sustainability assessment, and thematic (guest) lectures from Environmental History, Environmental Technology and Environmental Policy lecturers on the past, present and future of water and energy systems.<br/>Apart from preparing and attending lectures, students will write individual essays guided by lecturers and peer students during small group sessions, and participate in an excursion to innovative water and/or energy projects in the Netherlands.",

  "This course is part of the minor Archaeology. \n \nThe course is organised as a series of capita selecta, which will guide the participants chronologically through examples of material culture dating from ca. 500 to ca. 1500 AD. The main question that unifies everything is in how far, when, and how material culture can be useful to scholars, and how such sources can [or cannot] be meaningfully studied in conjunction with written texts from the same period. Why, for instance, have certain types of brooches been labelled ‘Frankish’, and what does the use of this term presuppose and imply? And is this the same ‘Frankish’ as we find in early medieval historiography? Can human remains with stakes through their hearts be sensibly interpreted as ‘vampires’? What new insights about manuscript culture can we gain by approaching a medieval codex not as a series of texts, but as an object? What can we learn about urban culture if we do not confine research to written sources, but focus on the built environment itself? Through reflecting on such questions, it will become eminently clear that researchers can never get away with stating that ‘archaeology has proven that….’, for the interpretation of material culture is as varied and ever-changing as the interpretation of the past itself. A fieldtrip to a Medieval site in the Netherlands is part of the course.\nThe courses in this minor are taught in English. If all students are native Dutch speakers, the course will be taught in Dutch. Students may complete their assignments, papers and tests in either Dutch or English.\nbody { font-size: 9pt;",

  "Consumers are often treated as individual decision makers, however their choices are in fact embedded in all sorts of social, political and material contexts. In this course consumption practices are placed in such contexts, at the level of the household, at the level of lifestyles and at the level of societal change. The household is an important context for consumption as this is where most consumption occurs, consumer decisions are made, routines are lived and the everyday takes place. At a larger scale lifestyles, shared by people who do not know each other, form an important context for consumption. Such lifestyles can empirically be assessed as socio-cultural patterning of consumption, but they also have a socially binding effect and structure consumption choices. People and households who share the same lifestyle tend to interact with each other and make similar choices when confronted with new consumption options. At societal level, consumption and lifestyles are affected by economic and political transformations, including modernization, sustainable development, economic (de-)growth and crisis, and welfare arrangements. The course will connect concrete empirical examples of specific lifestyles, e.g. related to food and sustainable development with more abstract theoretical perspectives on consumer society.",

  "This course offers the basic theories in the field of remote sensing, starting from the information needs of various land applications. It is directed at providing a basic knowledge of remote sensing concepts and methods: recording techniques in the optical and microwave region, image construction, digital image analysis and pattern recognition, geometric and atmospheric correction procedures and the subsequent quality of images. Then image classification is dealt with. As a next step, the estimation of biophysical object properties is treated using both statistical and radiative transfer approaches. Special emphasis is on imaging spectroscopy. Subsequently, monitoring through time-series analysis is dealt with. Finally, new developments will be dealt with. Throughout the course attention is paid to the possibilities and limitations of remote sensing from airplanes and satellites as a source of information for the inventory, monitoring and policy making in the fields of agriculture, forestry, land use, agrohydrology, nature conservation and environmental issues. Handling remote sensing data yourself is central in the practical.",

Students will learn about different modes of democratic set-up (parliamentary vs. presidential democracy), various political institutions (political parties, legislatures, courts, cabinets, etc.), and their interactions, which are necessary for the production of policy. Students will be introduced to coalition-formation theory, median voter theory, agenda-setting theory, veto player theory. In addition, they will become acquainted with analytical tools such as game theory, as well as to the comparative method and its various empirical forms (qualitative and quantitative studies, case or large-N studies). Through discussions of real-world political phenomena, we will evaluate the usefulness of each method. One of the running themes in the course is the theme of different political regimes (democracy vs. dictatorship), as well as how do states transition between the two. Through these themes, students will be introduced to basic game theory, which can be used to analyze complex political decision-making situation in a most simplified manner. To practice this, students will be able to create and solve their own games and discuss and critique the usefulness of such models for understanding the complexity of everyday political interaction. By keeping up with the world political news, reading the assigned literature, and actively participating in class, students will learn the basis of doing social science research. By the end of the course students are expected to have gained a good understanding of how polities arise and have a deeper knowledge about the various political institutions and their desired, as well as perhaps undesired, effects both theoretically, and empirically (within the country which they will focus on throughout the course).",

  "<p>Todays’ quality managers in food supply chains and researchers have to deal with the complexity and dynamics of food production systems and management systems of organisations within changing environments. It requires understanding of the main functions in food quality management (i.e. design, control, improvement, assurance and policy and strategy) and the interplay with the technological food production system, and the external business environment. It sets high demands on science-based problem-solving skills of people working in the field of food quality management. <br/>Food Quality Management (FQM) research encompasses the field of analysing and mitigating (solving) complex food quality management issues. It embodies understanding of technological aspects of agri-materials, ingredients and final foods and their food production systems (from stable to table), and how these affect product quality and safety. Moreover, it involves understanding of aspects related to people behaviour, quality management processes, organisational structures, supply chain management, governance (etc.), and how these affect the performance of the FQM functions (design, control etc.) aimed at realising and ensuring food quality. <br/>The research paradigm in food quality management defines food quality as a function of behaviour of both food systems and human systems. This paradigm requires a concurrent analysis of theories from technological sciences and from management and social sciences to obtain a broader insight in the possible causes of the problem and to provide a more comprehensive view on possible solutions or ways to mitigate the FQM issue. This is the so-called techno-managerial approach, which is central in this course.<br/>The research principles course (FQD-64306) builds further on the basic course FQD-20306 and aims at learning how to apply the techno-managerial approach in appreciating, defining and conceptualising complex FQM issues (research skills). Furthermore, the course will deepen knowledge in the domain of food quality management and train students in scientific reporting.<br/>Major topics addressed in this course include:<br/>- research principles in food quality management; techno-managerial approach;<br/>- food quality managements functions and core concepts in food quality management (design, control, improvement, assurance, and policy &amp; strategy);<br/>- complexity of food quality management;<br/>- technological and managerial factors affecting performance of FQM functions and food quality;<br/>- constructing conceptual research framework;<br/>- defining measurable indicators to analyse factors;<br/>- scientific reporting.<br/></p>",

  "This course gives an overview and insight in the economics of the farm business, with a focus on financial management and accounting. Like corporate managers, farm managers continuously have to make decisions and control their business. There is a need to adapt their business to the current external environment and to anticipate future internal and external developments. For this purpose farm managers need reliable financial data based on a well defined accounting system, a good analysis of these data and information for decision making. Also stakeholders like banks, suppliers, government etc. have interest in reliable data and information from farms. This course deals with the financial management and accounting of the farm business both from the perspective of the farm manager and the other stakeholders.<br>\r<br/>Note: emphasis will be on both qualitative and (particularly) quantitative analysis and explanation.",

  "This course is a follow up of the course Business and Consumer perspectives on Food Quality. Innovative consumer-oriented food companies have to stay connected with society by gathering and managing consumer data, turning them into insights, and translating those insights into new actions or product concepts. Over the last decade consumers’ consciousness of various major trends of food products has become an important factor driving product development in the agri-food sector. Consequently, the food industry has reacted to these trends by developing a growing variety of new products related to these images. In the course ‘Research topics on food and society’, you do a research on consumer wishes (social sciences) and product innovation (natural sciences), in which information from different disciplines is integrated. <br/>The aim is to come up with concepts for new food products that are interesting for the Dutch market, which are feasible to be produced by the participating company and are according to preferences of consumers. The students will work during the course in groups of maximum six persons together and will present their final product innovation concept at a 'Market' for stakeholders and students, and will deliver a scientific poster and a 'decision paper'.",

  "<p>Water erosion is one of the most important  and widespread soil degradation processes worldwide, which may threaten food security for many people. Water erosion is particular important on sloping lands in semi-arid, humid tropical and temperate areas. Controlling water erosion requires a thorough understanding of the processes involved and an ability to quantify sediment transport rates. Erosion models are used to better understand the processes of soil erosion and to assess the effect of soil and water conservation measures, land use change and climate effects.<br/>This specialized course deals with several topics relevant to experimental studies of erosion processes, as well as modelling of erosion and sedimentation dynamics. During the lectures the following topics related to modelling concepts and to water erosion processes are presented: the concept of modelling, building up a model, processes of soil erosion and their conceptualization, analysing model performance and quality. The students will work with two water erosion models; one event-based, detailed soil erosion model and one landscape evolution model. (Differences in) procedures and outcomes will be discussed.

  "Motto; \"Designing at first is language, association and imaginative craft, and not until then artistic experiment. The visualisation of the design represents the various aspects and qualities precisely and in an attractive, but above all convincing way\".\r<br/>This course is the follow up course for LAR 29806 Planting Construction and Representation 1. The learned content and practiced skills will further be developed and the content will be more into depth. The goal of the course is to establish a core visual literacy in representational media by considering work across a range of disciplines, including: photography, film, freehand drawing, detailed design of planting and construction, 3D modeling, synthetic imaging and animation, besides written and verbal representation.\r<br/>Knowledge on outdoor construction is applied in design assignments and digital 3D drawings and 3D models. Outdoor construction is obtained by deconstruction selected objects and re-drawing them digitally. Sketches and perspectives, diagrams, plan- and section drawings, impressions and technical details describe the structure, the visual experience and technical aspects of a design project in various drawing projections and scale levels. Plant assortment is applied in design assignments including growth schemes and biotope development. A one-week field observation and drawing excursion is part of this course. The exercises during this week are linked to the various studios and courses.  Although the emphasis will be on still image development, there will be extensive use of animation, imagery and iterative workflows to develop dynamic representations of the landscape environment across a range of perceptual models and films. \r<br/>During the course the student works partly on an individual basis on the several assignments, besides that the student is trained to collaborate on assignments as a design team, where the different aspects, qualities of design and roles in a team will be separated in deliberation between the team members. Therefor the course implicates several competitive moments.  All the above written needs to be developed. The result should be an advanced contemporary course in which todays technics on Freehand drawing 3D modeling, use of film and photography are taught on a high standard.                 \r<br/>Drawing week\r<br/>The drawing week is an obligatory part of the course.

A historical and sociological approach of the (mutual) impact of agricultural science and technology on agrarian development will be the main focus of this course. Emphasis is put on the historical dimensions: how agriculture and technology have interacted in different epochs and different socio-economic contexts. Both analytical and theoretical concepts (and tools) will be offered to analyse agrarian change in the different eras and areas. The current debates on agricultural and rural transitions will be studied and analysed for its implications on bio system engineering. The socio-economic and cultural environment will be articulated as a 'horizon of relevance' for technological design in agricultural practices. The interactions between science, technology and society will be analysed through different case-studies. Both form an sociological and a historical point of view. The course also addresses phenomena such as technique, technology, science, ethics and society.<br/><br/></p>",

Resource use includes the exploitation of timber, the collection of fruits and resin, the extraction of wood for biomass production, hunting of animals. Ideally such resources are exploited in a sustainable way, but how should that be defined? And how is sustainable resource use quantified? And, how does resource availability fluctuate over time? In the course, these and other questions will be treated. Students will get hands-on experience in quantifying effects of resource utilization on future resource availability and ecosystem characteristics.\r<br/>In this course we will treat the following topics:\r<br/>- status of resources exploited from natural ecosystems worldwide: timber, non-timber, wildlife;\r<br/>- exploitation as a conservation strategy: concepts and basic theory; \r<br/>- quantification of resource availability: timber, non-timber products, wildlife;\r<br/>- analysis of the natural dynamics of populations or ecosystems providing resources: simple models;\r<br/>- effects of exploitation on future resource availability: simple models.\r<br/>During the course students will learn to use simple modelling tools to evaluate the dynamics of resources and the effects of exploitation.

  "This course introduces a range of basic concepts and design approaches that address the typical issues that landscape architects as designers are confronted with. The aim of the course is to make students aware of different design concepts and approaches. The course gives a rough overview of general concepts and world views, such as positivism and constructivism that can influence design procedures. Then, procedural design approaches will be presented to the students in a polarized way to trigger flexible design thinking and intense common discussion and reflection. On the one hand, these approaches concern the 'internal factors' - the designer's personality and the related types of creativity. Design approaches that relate to these 'internal factors' are: intuitive versus rational designing. They will be discussed and experienced 'hands on' in small exercises. The second set of approaches concerns the 'design context' - amongst which the type of design brief, the (urban) landscape context, its scale, the factor time, (un)expected changes and stakeholders. Design approaches that pertain to these contextual issues are 'closed' (e.g. fixed 'master plans', operational design) versus 'open' or strategic design approaches (amongst which are scenarios, frameworks, and also first insights into Research Through Designing). Design approaches relating to 'design context' will be discussed and compared with  reference projects and in relation to ongoing studio work in other courses.

  "Due to their sessile nature, plants have developed a vast array of adaptation mechanisms to cope with seasonal or sudden changes in the growth environment. These adaptation mechanisms mostly consist of species-, environment- and stress- specific changes in the basal morphological and physiological processes, shared by all plants. The success with which plants are able to survive under a wide range of environmental stresses (high and low temperature; drought, humid and flooded conditions; high concentrations of salt; shadow and high light; mechanical  (wind) stress; etc.) is based on their high plasticity and the flexibility of their morphology and physiology. This is expressed in adaptations in relation to e.g.:<br/>- uptake, exchange and transport of water and nutrients;<br/>- photosynthesis;<br/>- (dynamics of) architecture of plants;<br/>- biomechanics of structural strength;<br/>- responses to stress conditions;<br/>- reproductive behaviour; etc.<br/>The course focuses on mechanisms, regulation and genetic principles of plasticity in structure and physiology needed for plants to adapt to environmental variations and extremes. Lecturers from different disciplines in plant science will contribute varying topics within the scope of the course.",

  "In many countries in Europe, the America's and Asia the impact of the health sector on public and private spending is continuously increasing. As average individual life expectancy is growing, the demands placed upon the health sector are increasing. This makes this sector a domain in which economic principles, social responsibility and ethics continuously strive for priority. Many paradoxes, tensions and dilemma's characterize the sector. There is for instance the ongoing discussion about the accessibility of individuals to health care and the degree to which this is secured by the system as such; there is the paradox between cooperation and competition as well as the role of governments or markets as allocators of resources. On a managerial level there is the dilemma which managers in the health sector face when deciding about cost control measures and the quality of the services which health organizations should provide. These tensions, paradoxes and dilemmas are strongly influenced by international trends like deregulation and privatization. This very dynamic and complex sector will be the subject of study in the course 'Management and Economics of Health Care and Public Health'. \r<br/>During the course economic, organizational and managerial aspects of health care and public health will be examined such as the way the sector is structured and organized as well as the role of different players like government, NGO's, health care professionals and public and private firms play. Managerial and administrative issues of the recent health care reforms will be studied as well as the role of leadership in initiating and anchoring change and innovation in the public health sector. The course also discusses the dilemmas managers face as well as the strategies which the different key-players develop and deploy in this dynamic and complex environment. Health care reforms will be discussed and the way health care organizations transform themselves in response to the system changes. \r<br/>Trends in public health and reforms in health care are critically analyzed. In the discussion on strategic and organizational issues in the public health and care sector, various economic approaches are applied and examples from various countries in the field of public health and health care will be presented. Attention is paid to the variation in and performance of public health systems. Nowadays, economic evaluation is gaining importance in health care policies. Methods of economic evaluation as cost benefit analysis (CBA) and cost-effectiveness analysis will be critically examined and discussed.",

  "This course introduces communication students to key concepts and research problems in the life-sciences. Using models and theories from science communication, it surveys dominant and alternative ways of thinking about technology and societal change in the life-sciences. The course concentrates on six domains: health, food, urbanisation, climate change, natural resource management, and sustainability related to food and fibre production. At the end of the course, students will be able to make an informed choice which of the six domains to select as their focus area ('track') in following courses and their BSc thesis. The course will address aspects of science communication that enable students to understand the rationale of natural scientific and social scientific reasoning. The course follows a basic understanding of complex societal issues in life-science related domains. It starts with an introduction into the basics of interdisciplinary collaboration between life-sciences and communication science and practice. The main part of the course introduces students to elementary natural science concepts addressing issues around health, food, urbanisation, climate change, natural resource management and sustainability related to food and fibre production.

  "Many of the most pressing contemporary social and economic issues (like poverty, unemployment, slums, environmental degradation) are narrowly linked with demographic processes (population growth or decline, migration, epidemics) and the functioning of the family. These demographic processes diverge widely across the globe. For example, while many European countries face a future of population decline and an ageing population, many African countries experience rapid population growth and have a very young population structure. Such demographic trends and situations have huge effects on both the opportunities and problems they are faced with, in for example health care, education, employment and welfare systems.<br/>This course addresses these issues and connections in a global and dynamic perspective. It does not aim at producing demographers. But it does introduce you to the basics of demographic analysis and data collection, necessary for students to be able to understand demographic trends and their implications, and to be able to participate in the debate on global population issues. Several specific issues and examples, taken from all parts of the world and from different periods in time, are discussed, as well as their implications for policy, institutions (including healthcare) and business.",

At the lowest integration level we will deal with the characteristics of food and foragers, especially herbivores with their feeding adaptations. Attention will be paid to the role of body weight as an important determinant in many foraging traits. Optimal foraging theory lies at the heart of foraging decisions of animals and therefore ample attention will be given to the factors shaping functional response curves, diet selection, patch choice and habitat selection. Movement ecology deals with searching for resources. Interspecific interactions are thought to play a major role in shaping animal communities and the focus will be on competitive, facilitative and predatory interactions. At the highest level of integration, the structure and functioning of animal communities will be discussed. Which factors determine population size, birth, mortality and migration; what is the role of body weight?

  "<p>Note: This course has a maximum number of participants. Due to course logistics, students cannot register for this course later than March 13th.<br/>All life is connected, both from an ecological viewpoint as well as an evolutionary perspective. Moreover, this connectedness is an essential attribute, at the level of populations, communities and ecosystems.<br/>Food webs are descriptions of biological communities focusing on trophic interactions between consumers and resources. This way, trophic interactions represent pathways in the cycling of matter, energy and nutrients. Food web interactions significantly influence the dynamics and persistence of populations by determining the availability of resources and mortality rates due to predation. As a result, food webs are important drivers of biodiversity in ecosystems, and allow to upscale environmental effects from the level of individuals and population to that of ecosystems. <br/>Food webs provide a comprehensive framework for this course, in which you will learn the theoretical background of these webs, as well as practical skills that allow you to dissect them. During field work at a range of sites and habitats in the highly biodiverse French Pyrenees, you will train your recognition and identification skills, by becoming acquainted with morphological traits, and by learning microscopic and DNA-based techniques. Furthermore, you will gather data for ecological and evolutionary analyses during the practicals in the Pyrenees, and you will gather samples to be analysed back in Wageningen. <br/><br/></p>",

  "<p>In this course, we explore how organisations cope with changes in their environment, in terms of both external and internal communication. Externally, organisations have to know what is going on, they must present themselves, relate to others and they must negotiate. Internally, organisations need to accept change as a basic mechanism for staying “in tune”. The question is what communication can contribute to an adequate orientation of an organisation on an environment that continuously changes. We explore and discuss currently relevant themes in this context, supported by various theoretical perspectives and a range of case materials. Why and how do organisations relate to their environments? What do interactions imply for an organisation’s reputation? What does relating to the environment mean for an organisation’s identity – members’ own ideas about what the organisation stands for? How do organisations handle questions of social responsibility, and why? How can they communicate when there is a crisis and their reputation is harmed? We study how organizations can act strategically in these matters, exploring different theoretical approaches as also the application of such approaches to the analysis of real-life organisational communication challenges and strategic decision making with regard to communication. <br/></p>",

Interventions that aim at tackling the root causes of land degradation and at fostering sustainable land management are now more than ever essential. In this course students learn how land managers and policy makers plan, implement and assess interventions for sustainable land management, with a special focus on developing countries and the challenge of achieving widespread sustainable impact. The lectures are divided in five blocks: 1) land degradation and soil threats; 2) land management interventions and impact; 3) assessing impact of land degradation and SLM; 4) using GIS for land degradation and development; 5) towards widespread impact and development. The course starts with deepening the understanding of land degradation threats and processes, with special focus on Europe and current soil threats. Next, focus shifts to the role of stakeholders in land management interventions – from farmers to policy makers – and how their involvement affects sustainable impact and contributes to (local and global) development. This is followed by lectures and practical assignments to learn how to assess impact of land management interventions (e.g. multi-criteria analysis, cost-benefit analysis). Furthermore, during a practical assignment of 2 weeks students will get acquainted with the use of GIS for erosion and land management, and how this knowledge can be used for designing strategies for land management interventions. By the end of the course students will have obtained essential knowledge and skills that are needed by project managers or land use planners in any development project, and understand the essence to achieve widespread impact in sustainable land management.</span></p><p></p>",

  "Within certain limits, animals can compensate environmental stress and changes in the environment (homeostasis). Homeostasis is the basis of the adaptive capacity of an individual. The amount and the predictability of stress determine how much adaptive capacity is used to survive, and what is available for health, disease resistance, welfare, and (re) production. This is true both for abiotic as well as biotic loads of an individual. This introduction course deals with the various mechanisms through which environmental factors influence the animal (as far as known), and the consequences of the effects on (infectious) disease resistance, and the capacity to (re)produce. The effects of environmental factors (temperature, light, dust, air and climate) and their effects on terrestrial and aquatic animals will be discussed. This should contribute to obtain knowledge on the basal husbandry demands of animals.

  "This course is based on a few lectures, presentations by all participants of relevant literature, discussions in small teams and several assignments. Molecular biology has made impressive strides in elucidating the molecular regulation of processes in plants, but the challenge is to understand what this means for processes in real crops as this is the level at which farmers act to produce food, forage, fibre, and fuel. Recent developments in crop physiology relating to primary processes (photosynthesis, resource capture and use), plant and crop structure (signalling, communication and organization; partitioning; quality), and plant and crop adaptation to stress are presented. Special attention will be paid to innovative phenotyping platforms, the phenotype-genotype gap, to the interactions between genotype and environment, and to the possibilities to include genetic information in crop models, for example on the basis of gene-based modelling (or QTL-based modelling). It will be demonstrated how including genetic information may contribute to model-based ideotyping, model-based explorations of ecological  distribution of varieties and model-based marker-based selection.",

  "<p>This course addresses the development of sustainable food based dietary guidelines (FBDG). <br/>FBDG are intended to establish a basis for public food and nutrition, health and agricultural policies and nutrition education programmes to foster healthy eating habits and lifestyles. They provide advice on foods, food groups and dietary patterns to provide the required nutrients to the general public to promote overall health and prevent chronic diseases. </p><p>The need to shift to more sustainable diets and food systems is increasingly evident but certainly not simple to achieve. According to the definition by FAO, the sustainability of diets goes beyond nutrition and environment as to include economic and socio-cultural dimensions. <br/>For the development of sustainable FBDG many sources of information need to be critically assessed and integrated, such as scientific evidence of the relationship between diet, nutrition, dietary patterns and health; data on food composition; data on food production and sustainability; food consumption, cost, accessibility and acceptability. </p><p>Linear programming analysis (also called linear optimization) is a mathematical operational research approach that can be used to model complex multifactorial problems, including diet-related problems. Models can be developed to formulate and optimize robust FBDGs, which resemble current dietary practices as closely as possible, while at the same time ensuring that diets based on them simultaneously meet selected nutrient recommendations and sustainability indicators. <br/><br/></p>",

  "<p>Applied animal ecology is a subfield within ecology that considers the application of the science of animal ecology to management questions. The purpose of the course Applied Animal Ecology is to provide students with the theoretical background underlying wildlife population management. The question central to this course is how to maintain, increase, or decrease the size of wildlife populations. We will first give students the theoretical aspects of animal ecology on which common practices in wildlife population management are based. We put emphasis on how the growth of wildlife populations is regulated by food availability, and is negatively impacted by predators and diseases. Furthermore, we discuss the anthropogenic impact of harvesting and hunting. Lastly, we consider the types and effectiveness of the different measures of population size increases and reductions that a wildlife manager has at hand. To place the theory into perspective, we provide case studies on terrestrial animals of the European continent. At the end of the course, students will  write a wildlife population management plan. In this plan, the theory dealt with in the first weeks should be applied to tackle a particular wildlife management problem.<br/></p>",

  "During this course you will analyse and develop agri-food production chains considering their economic, social and environmental impact. Focus will be on the application of quantitative tools for evaluation of sustainability performance. Traditionally, agro-food production chains are aimed at isolation of a single ingredient, in future, raw materials will be 'refined' into as many valuable fractions as possible. In this course you will learn how to combine processing steps to use less energy and water and to aim at multi-product recovery. Additionally, you will learn about the application of enzymes for enhanced use of agricultural resources. Important is the analysis of efficiency and identification of locations of inefficiency in food production chains. This will be done on the basis of mass flow analysis, Sankey diagrams, and embodied values of energy and water.  In addition you will carry out life cycle analysis (LCA) on food production chains. Using LCA techniques you avoid focusing on a single environmental impact, such as global warming. Instead, you consider complex interrelations with other aspects of sustainability, such as eutrophication, animal welfare, land use or food security. Where current food production is carried out at large central plants, production in the future may be better distributed over the production chain. Choices discussed will be concerned with different sustainable distribution modes. Finally, design principles (e.g. cradle-to-cradle) on sustainability will be explained and applied. The course will conclude with a design task on a novel sustainable agro- food product and its chain.",

  "Agriculture contributes significantly to global warming through large scale greenhouse gas emissions. At the same time many agriculture systems are vulnerable to climate change and without adaptation global food production could significantly reduce affecting food security. In response to these challenges the concept of climate smart agriculture has been developed. Climate-smart agriculture (CSA) aims to address the interlinked challenges of food security and climate change through an integrated approach. For example an better integration of land and water management is necessary to adapt to future climate change while at the same time reducing emissions. Climate smart agriculture combines three different objectives (1) sustainable increase of agricultural production (2) Adaptation of  agricultural and food security systems to climate change; and (3) reducing greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture. To improve both climate change mitigation and adaptation of the agricultural sector these issues need to addressed at different spatial scales (from farm to landscape & local to global) and at time scales (from season to decades).\r<br/>During the course the students will learn about the main principles of climate smart agriculture. The student will learn how agricultural systems including both plant and animal systems. contribute to climate change through the emissions of CO2, N2O and CH4. The course will address the main processes causing these emissions and which mitigation measures can be used to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Similarly, the course will address the main impacts of climate change on on agricultural systems and food security, how these impacts can be assessed and which adaptation measures can be used the reduce the vulnerability of agricultural systems and improve food security. The course will address how climate change affects water and land use management including issues such as future water availability and plant growth and which land and water use changes are needed to adapt to future climate. The key of climate smart agriculture is integrating adaptation and mitigation into existing farming systems and land and water use practices. Especially in developing countries ideally this would combined with higher agricultural production and improved food security. The course will address cases from both developed and the developing world focusing on for example dryland systems in Africa, rice based farming systems in Asia and mixed farming systems in Europe. \r<br/>During the course the students will develop a climate smart agricultural farming systems for their case. The student will assess the greenhouse gas emission and the climate change impacts using simple farming systems models.  Based on these analyses the student will design different adaptation and mitigation measures which need to be integrated into a climate smart strategy for their case.",

Revoluties lijken overal rondom Europa op de loer te liggen, trekken zich niets aan van landsgrenzen, en hebben een grote invloed op de wereld waarin wij leven. Tegelijk leveren ze altijd een stevig debat op, want hoe moeten we revoluties eigenlijk waarderen en begrijpen? Zorgen ze voor chaos, oorlog en geweld? Of zijn ze de drempel naar democratische samenlevingen en sociale rechtvaardigheid? En even belangrijk: hoe komen ze eigenlijk tot stand? En waarom slagen sommige revoluties wel en andere niet?\nIn deze cursus onderzoeken we revoluties en andere vormen van politieke omwenteling over een langere historische periode. We doen dit door verschillende theorieën en verklaringen voor oorzaak, verloop, en gevolg van revoluties, staatsgrepen en regime changes te bestuderen en analyseren hierbij specifiek de rol van sociale klassen, de rol van de staatsactoren, de invloed van ideologieën, en het proces van politieke transitie. We passen deze verschillende verklaringen vervolgens toe op concrete revolutionaire voorbeelden in de geschiedenis vanaf de achttiende eeuw tot en met de Arabische Lente in de wereld van nu. In hun paper passen studenten vervolgens één of meer van deze verschillende perspectieven zelf toe op een concrete revolutionaire casus in heden of verleden. Studenten leren zo in deze cursus verschillende perspectieven op revoluties op waarde schatten en ontdekken hoe revoluties zo’n grote impact blijven hebben op het verloop van de geschiedenis.",

  "Scientific research methods are key to sound research and should be explicit, transparent, accountable, and adequate. Ultimately, opting for adequate methods serves to make research valid and reliable and thus credible. For conducting scientific research autonomously, a researcher must not only be able to apply given methods, but also evaluate their adequacy, choose amongst and amend existing methods, and critically reflect on their feasibility to address identified research questions. These capacities belong to the realm of research methodology opting for explicit methodological frameworks and  thinking critically about related methods. This includes assessing the consequences of theoretical perspectives for choosing and designing methods (including the implications of the ontological and epistemological assertions inherent within the theoretical perspectives), negotiating the pros and cons of a variety of methods, debating and reflecting on the credibility of research processes and outcomes, and finally reflecting on ethical implications. This course taps into all of these issues, both in the natural and social sciences; it refers to the methodologies of cases studies and surveys, and to the qualitative and quantitative methods of data collection, analysis, and interpretation as habitually used in observation, semi-structured interviews, and questionnaires. The course will pay close attention to relationships between different planning and design contexts, and theory and methods. The course also trains students in formulating a research proposal as part of a MLP thesis proposal.",

The perspectives addressed include Health Promotion Principles, Salutogenesis, Ecological Health approach and Life Course perspective. The perspective that you take as a starting point affects the issues you identify, the way you set up research and the solutions that you find.<br/>In this course we will look at environmental determinants of health at different levels of the built environment. We will discuss home-, neighbourhood-, city- and regional environments and the role they play regarding people' s health. Students will conduct their own local-level research to assess how social and physical determinants affect health in a neighbourhood environment. The central questions in this course are: what environmental determinants for health are present at different environmental levels, how do these determinants influence health, and what are possibilities from the perspective of a health promotor to take health into account when designing an environment.</p>",

  "This course offers an introduction to academic (source-based) research In the field of expertise of International Relations in historical perspective.\nFirstly, this concerns research design: the conceptualization and planning of a research project with an original, academically sound research question an a well-defined method to select and study the relevant primary and secondary sources. Learning this prepares you for the research for and writing of a BA Thesis in your third year.\nSecondly, it concerns a thorough introduction to research based on primary sources. After all, the ability to find, study and critically evaluate both primary and secondary sources and to use them effectively are crucial skills for any historian. You will not only study archive collections in an archive institution, but also learn how to work with digital sources and historical databases. You will also learn how to use and analyse non-textual sources such as artefacts and interviews, and photos, films and other multimedia resources. Furthermore, you will learn how to link different types of sources to relevant research methods, as well as how to document and manage the research data which you derive from these diverse resources. Finally, you will work actively on the link between sources and research questions and learn how to embed your research in broader academic debates.\nThirdly, it concerns knowledge transfer: students will learn how the results of their research can be made to have a societal impact and find audiences outside of academia.\nTo give you a frame of reference, the course offers a number of introductory lectures on the theoretical foundations and history of the field of expertise of International Relations in historical perspective. Through the combination of practical source analysis and theorizing you’ll learn to sort, describe and analyse different types of sources, put them in the context of academic debate and use them in your own research project. This will equip you with the research skills required to carry out research in the field of International Relations in historical perspective.",

  "This course introduces communication students to the discipline of public administration. Public administration scholars analyze how the world of public governance functions and develop suggestions to strengthen governance in the network society. Knowledge about public governance is essential to communication students, because: (i) governance is about how societies deal with perceived problems and as such shapes everyday actions and institutions, (ii) ideas and (political) communication play a big role in how public and private actors frame societal problems and possible solutions within governance networks, and (iii) governments and other governance actors are both important sources and objects of communication. During the course, students will learn how public administration thinking about public governance, and particularly the role of ideas and communication herein, evolved over time. They do so by reading a classic book from the field of public administration and by discussing this work in small reading groups. During the lectures, these classic works are contextualized and linked to ongoing political events and processes, particularly those that are relevant to the life sciences domains. The course ends with an excursion to The Hague, where students will experience the role of communication in real-life politics and policymaking.",

The schedule for the academic year at Breda University of Applied Sciences differs from the schedule of Wageningen University. The periods mentioned are the periods of Wageningen University. <br/><br/>The focus of the course is on introducing students to the art and science of tourism systems analysis. Important tools and methods of systems analysis are conceptual modelling, integrated (environmental) assessment, and scenarios. In many practical settings it is not enough to understand a tourism system better; a key challenge is also to reach some kind of conclusion to inform decision makers amidst (deep) uncertainty. This requires assessment methods, such as cost-benefit analysis and multi-criteria analysis, and other methods that can handle both uncertainty and trade-offs.<br/>Integration is not only a matter of knowledge, but also of practice and judgement. During the whole course, students will acquire hands-on experience with the tools for integration and assessment, also by working on case assignments.</p>",

  "<p>The dynamics of ecological systems are driven by multiple interacting processes and are therefore considered complex. Through modelling, we simplify this complexity of ecological reality in order to better understand the key processes and relationships between system components, and ultimately improve our insight in an ecological problem. In this course, you will learn to use the concepts of systems analysis to describe, understand and analyse complex, ecological systems quantitatively. The focus is on the behaviour of deterministic (repeatable) dynamic models of ecological systems. You will learn how to work with differential equations that determine changes in the modelled system and link these to algebraic descriptions to Forrester and state-flow diagrams. Further, you will learn to work with R software to analyse data and to implement, test and solve mathematical models. You will apply these new skills in evaluating the characteristics and quality of applied models, which are currently used by scientists and policy makers. </p><p><br/></p><p>In this course, the major focus will be on terrestrial (tundra and forest) and aquatic (fresh water lake) ecosystems. The goal is to understand the dynamics in, for example, the abundance of species populations, production, or succession of species in such systems as determined by processes, which are often driven by environmental conditions. You will learn to simplify, conceptualize, build, implement, test and run models of ecological systems. The learning trajectory of this course takes three steps: 1) starting with conceptual diagrams and mathematical tools (the theory and concepts of ecological modelling), 2) implementation of mini-models in an R environment, and 3) evaluation of existent applied models.

  "<p>To deal with the complexity of rural development, sustainability and social welfare problems, standardized learning processes often prove inadequate. Each issue and context requires different solutions. Different stakeholders therefore need to engage in sharing of knowledge and perspectives, manage conflicts, create mutual understanding and define shared goals to subsequently commit themselves to instrumental fact-finding, creative experiments and action. To attain this exquisite inquiry, brokerage and facilitation are needed. Without facilitation important groups may be forgotten, critical views unheard, ideas remain unexplored and unarticulated, consensus forced and proposed solutions may be ineffective when implemented.<br/>Hence it is important that researchers, policy makers and development professionals involved in interactive change processes have basic communication skills, and know the potential and limitation of different facilitation methodologies. The course 'Facilitating Interactive Processes' aims at equipping 'new' professionals with such skills and knowledge. This course has the character of a practical aimed at experimentation and critical reflection on explored facilitation skills and methodologies. What is the effect triggered on group dynamics, learning and action? In doing so it builds on the conceptual ideas and context information presented in earlier courses. The course enhances students' capacity to translate conceptual ideas into actual intervention practice.<br/>This course forms with the course YSS-60806 the Academic Master Cluster for the MDR programme.</p>",

In het vak staan steeds 2 tot 3 belangrijke thema’s centraal (zoals geschiedenis, wetenschap, geweld, kunst, verantwoordelijkheid of taal).

Het onderscheid tussen continentaal en analytisch is voor een belangrijk deel een verschil in filosofische methode.

  "<p>The course aims to teach students the concepts involved in research on host microbe interactions rather than a detailed technological training in the field, which may be taught in follow-up MSc-thesis studies. <br/>The intestinal tract is colonized with a highly diverse and dense microbial population, and intestinal host microbe interactions play a prominent role in host-health and disease. Over the past years this field has expanded dramatically, and starts to decipher the molecular basis of these interactions and their importance in the determination of specific aspects of the host’s physiology, including metabolism, immunity, and behaviour. It is the aim of the course on ‘commensal and pathobiont host-microbe interactions in the intestine’ to understand the model systems and technological approaches applied in this field. <br/>The model systems, including several (germ-free) animal and human volunteer models, and their use is explained in the lecture series. The technologies presented in the lectures encompass both the holistic, ‘omics based approaches as well as the mechanistic, cell-based approaches that employ molecular markers and reporters in combination with imaging. The computer practical employs public and in house datasets and software modules to analyse them, aiming for hands-on experience in data analysis and extraction of biological understanding. During the case studies small groups of students work on a provided specific health and disease question, analyse the state-of-the-art (literature and public information sources), and present their findings in a plenary session at the end of the course. <br/></p>",

  "Quality is crucial in determining the demand for any product, yet the concept of quality is surprisingly elusive. Nonetheless, however difficult it is to provide a universally accepted definition of quality, products still have to be measured in order to classify them and to determine their suitability for specific purposes. Techniques are also needed with which to be able to analyse products in order to investigate their post-harvest changes. These techniques need to be understood not only as research tools but also as components of quality assurance procedures existing in trade. The course of lectures will introduce the physical, physiological and genomic basis for a wide range of techniques that have proved valuable for estimating the quality of horticultural and other plant products. Additionally the way that these quality measurements can be integrated into the management of the chain will be considered in depth. It will be clear that not all techniques will be suitable for all applications, and the criteria for suitability in specific applications will be discussed.",

Front-end subjects treated include various aspects, often collectively indicated as 'pre-breeding'. These include the domestication of plants, the gene pool concept, and germplasm development. Also, the importance of gene banks for storing and using genetic diversity present in wild material and landraces is treated. Inevitably, this also includes the discussion on ownership of biodiversity and the effects of international legislation about ownership.<br/>Back- end subjects also include legislation aspects, such as breeders' rights and patents. Seed quality in an important back-end aspect of plant breeding, because often the seeds make up the product that will be sold. But also for gene banks (front-end), seed quality and seed storage conditions are of utmost importance, because dead seed implies that genetic material is lost, sometimes forever.<br/>In addition, part of the course is dedicated to the concept of marker-assisted selection. The application of molecular markers is an important tool to make breeding programs more efficient, but markers may also be used to describe genetic diversity of plant populations and to test the identity and purity of lines. An important pre-breeding application of marker-assisted selection is the efficient selection for desired genes from wild material, while simultaneously selecting against all undesired wild genes.<br/>Thus, the course has a mixture of technical and societal/legislative aspects, all of which are important aspects of modern plant breeding.

In addition, you will read several state-of-the art articles/papers that enable you to develop a comprehensive understanding of the role of ICT in education. Students start with an introduction of the ICT themes through six web lecture and three articles. The Introduction web lectures and articles are mandatory for all students. From the remainder ICT themes, students can select six that interest them most.\n \n- The application of ICT in education: We refer to this by ‘Learning-by-designing’. In groups you will design a practical educational ICT application (you don’t have to develop it). The starting point is the ICT context from either your school or your teaching practice (or that of a fellow student) that you will analyze. Based on this analysis and the aforementioned theoretical foundation you will design an application in which ICT will be deployed to improve, strengthen or transform the didactics of a subject (e.g., math didactics) in secondary education. In addition, you have to write a well-argued evaluation report on the ICT application of another group. We also pay attention to the different types of ICT tools that can be used in schools, what you can do with them (with which ICT themes they connect) and how to use them effectively in the classroom.\n \n- Reflective practice: the course emphasizes that students (learn to) reflect on their ICT skills in education so as to engage in a process of continuous learning. You will do that by keeping up a journal regarding the development of your educational ICT skills. Material for this journal will come from studying the literature, the process of designing an educational ICT application and by profiling your educational ICT skills on the basis of a self-assessment and a peer assessment. You will do the latter at the beginning and at the end of the course.",

Free markets, the specialization of labour, entrepreneurship and the maximization of profit have brought unprecedented wealth to the developed world. Capitalism itself, however, turns out to be unstable. Growth and recession alternate, producing winners and losers. Critics of capitalism have proposed alternative economic orders, or argued for some moral order to be imposed on capitalist market economies.

  "Biomass has enormous potential for the production of chemicals, pharmaceuticals, energy, food and feed. For these applications the relevant chemical constituents of biomass have to be accessed and isolated. Biorefinery is the technology for sustainable processing of biomass into a spectrum of marketable products and energy. Biorefinery takes place using sequential (bio)chemical and mechanical process steps together with separation and isolation techniques. Every step needs resources (chemicals, energy, water) and produces byproducts. The degree of sustainability and the economic benefits of a biorefinery chain depend on the type and amount of biomass, types of processing steps, separation and isolation efficiency as well as efficient use of all biomass components and their application. This course is an introduction to biorefinery and gives a descriptive overview on state of the art technology and the separation principles used in biorefinery of plants, organisms and waste streams. Moreover, the course discusses methods to evaluate the efficiency and sustainability in terms of energy and water usage and indicators for economic evaluation.\r<br/>Specific subjects in the course are: \r<br/>- overview of biomass resources for biorefinery, their chemical composition and characteristic properties relevant for biorefinery; \r<br/>- chemical and biocatalytic treatment, separation and conversion; overview of the used chemical reactions and how they are facilitated/catalysed by enzymes or microbes; \r<br/>-properties for physical separation and physical separation methods;  \r<br/>- basic chain analysis of succeeding steps in a biorefinery chain by using basic overall mass and energy balances on products and resources as energy and water; \r<br/>- overall evaluation of the refinery efficiency and indicators for sustainability and economic performance.",

Special attention will be given to risk communication in the context of the life sciences and life science technologies such as malaria, zoonoses, gene technology, flooding, climate change, novel agro-technologies, and food scares. In our rapidly changing knowledge society, experts and non-experts tend to have different appreciations of science and technology issues. What exactly is the nature of these differences and what are the communicative implications? We will discuss psychological theories regarding risk perception. How do people process complex information regarding particular risks and what is the role of emotions therein? How does media coverage of risks affect the public's sense of anxiety? Attention will also be paid to sociological theories of risk and trust. Is there a general mistrust of science and technology, and can this be explained by a trust or knowledge deficit of the public? Under what conditions are institutions capable of handling and communicating risks? Throughout the course assignments and group work help students to translate theoretical insights to risk communication practices based on their own choice.

  "This course enables students to identify how interdisciplinary scientific perspectives from the social and natural sciences can contribute to a shared understanding of risk and problem solving in complex environmental problems. You will be asked to explore the possible role of science in the public policy process by bringing together key concepts in environmental toxicology, animal ecology, public policy, and environmental governance. In the first half of the course you will become acquainted with technical skills required for gathering, processing, and interpreting data on environmental toxicology and animal ecology, as well as relevant social science theories on the relationship between science and politics in the public policy process. You will participate in a policy simulation in which you must generate, interpret, and present scientific data needed to estimate and reduce the risk associated with poor environmental quality and unsustainable use of ecosystem services. The course caters for students with a background in either natural or social sciences by providing a unique opportunity to integrate both perspectives into practical process of environmental research and policy. You will be introduced to a range of natural science concepts and methods used to assess the exposure and effect of persistent toxic compounds accumulating in the food chain, posing risks for eel population success and the health of eel consumers. From the social science side you will be introduced to concepts that can be used to analytically interpret the values, interests, and strategies of stakeholders involved in policy processes around risk identification, definition, acceptance, and management. By the end of the course you will be able to apply these skills in both the analysis and practice of science and policy making, while also taking into account other possible explanations and solutions for the dramatic decline in eel populations.",

The course builds on the philosophy that the past is the key to the future; quantitative understanding of processes that form and alter soils and landscapes is needed to develop sustainable landscape management approaches and measures, e.g. through nature based solutions approaches.\r<br/>After introductory lectures, students will gain experience with different quantitative dating techniques including dendrochronology, radiocarbon, Ar/Ar-dating and luminescence dating, through exercises with real world datasets. In a next step, the relative importance of natural and human forcing factors for landscape evolution will be discussed. Drift sand activity in the Netherlands will provide a vivid example, which will be discussed both in the classroom, during a field excursion and with a group project. During the latter students deepen their skills and knowledge through: 1) work in the darkroom laboratory of the Netherlands Centre for Luminescence dating, to gather and analyze their own luminescence data, 2) interpret the results to reconstruct drift sand activity and landscape evolution of sandy landscapes, and 3) discuss the relevance of the results with regard to landscape-scale management efforts.",

Unless we make innovation processes responsive both to the needs of social actors and the bio-material world, future changes will occur without explicit societal shaping, commonly driven by the power of incumbent interests and the delegation of ‘the good’ to market forces. The course teaches students how to research the relationship between socio-technical practices, innovation processes and responsible futures.  In three blocks, students review the systematic for making descriptions of everyday practices, appraise the contextualisation of innovation and change processes in case studies, and conceptualise and use deliberative and anticipative methodologies. Each block combines reading of literature, individual or group assignments, and feedback on the reviews and applications of the methodological perspectives examined. The methodologies are contextualized as necessary and appropriate for helping society to get better at the conversation between today and tomorrow in an inclusive and socially robust manner. The course concludes with an individual assignment: writing a paper making a problem and question of own choice researchable.",

  "<p>The role of livestock in future food systems is heavily debated. The livestock sector provides essential nutrients, generates economic benefits, results in improved livelihoods, and provides labour to the worlds growing population. Livestock production, however, also has a severe impact on the environment. Livestock, furthermore, are often fed with products that we, as humans, can also eat, such as cereals, which causes competition for land between feed and food production and threatens future food security. For these reasons, and other reasons, many people argue that we should reduce our consumption of animal-source food (ASF) or that it would be best if we all went vegan. But is that really true? The aim of this course is to discuss the role of livestock in future food systems. During the course we will show different futures about the role of livestock in a sustainable food system, as outlined in the scientific literature, and explore and discuss various arguments underlying these futures. Some argue for example, that to feed an increasing and wealthier population demanding more ASF, we have to produce more ASF with less impact and focus on reducing the environmental footprints of individual ASF products. This route is generally referred to as sustainable intensification and is called the production narrative. Others argue that consuming ASF is resource-intensive and, therefore, should be avoided or limited – also referred to as the consumption narrative. Besides the environmental argument, this narrative also refers to ethical reasons and stresses that the high consumption levels of ASF, especially meat, in the western world are associated with the rise in non-communicable diet-related diseases, such as obesity, heart diseases, and cancer. In the last narrative, the circular narrative, production and consumption are combined. In a circular food system, we use biomass at its highest utility, just like in natural ecosystems. Livestock do play a key role in a circular food system, as they can convert biomass inedible for humans, so-called leftovers, and resources from grasslands, into nutritious ASF. Because mainly leftovers are fed to livestock, feed-food competition is avoided. The amount of ASF that can be obtained from leftovers, however, depends on their type and availability (e.g. by-products food industry, food waste, crop residues, grass from marginal land), and their utilization potential by animals. A circular food system, therefore, also affects our consumption pattern. To be able to answer the questions ‘whether or not it is best for the environmental if we all become a vegan’ you need to understand all three narratives. Not one of the narratives is right or wrong but yet they do yield different answers and therefore different  ‘futures’ of the role of livestock the food system. <br/>During this course we will discuss the current situation of livestock production but more importantly discuss strategies to improve the future role of livestock in a sustainable food system within each narrative. These strategies include the utilisation of leftovers by animals, the use of insects as livestock feed or human food, or a potential to re-introduce animal meal or food-waste as livestock feed. We will also discuss e.g. the important role of animal and human excreta to fertilize crop land or produce bio-energy, the importance of nose-to-tail eating, potential trade-offs and synergies between animal welfare and the environment, and the value of precision livestock farming. <br/></p>",

The students will undertake a site survey and analyse the site and context in sub- groups, partly with the help of experts. Students conduct precedent study on similar design assignments to develop their knowledge about different design traditions. Each student will develop a design concept. This is followed up by creating related design alternatives that show how they address the different issues in an attractive and comprehensive way. The designs are represented in drawings, diagrams, scale models, 3D artist impressions and/or other media. In a cyclic design study, the designs will be tested against various criteria. These are (depending on the site and respective assignment): 'fitting' into the natural and urban spatial context, response to the history of the site, functionality, addressing different user groups (with their different culture, age and gender issues), compliance with the concept and others.

  :goals
  "Though racism is mainly associated with the colonial slave experience and genocide in the Second World War, it has a much longer history that also ripples through to our own world today. This course studies the history of racism in the West from the Enlightenment to the present day. Our main focus is on the way in which ideas about race and ethnicity have evolved as categories of differentiation, hierarchy and exclusion. Students will research the complex interactions between these cultural constructs and the historical dimensions of nationalism, colonialism, imperialism and globalisation in Western history. The development of racism in Europe will be considered from an international and comparative perspective, in part through the study of colonial and transatlantic experiences of slavery and migration, as well as by researching the worldwide spread of ideals of equality, human rights and civil rights. In addition, we will look at how scientific and pseudoscientific constructs of racism, social Darwinism and eugenics were modelled from the nineteenth century onwards to legitimise differentiation and selection on the basis of racial characteristics. Finally, this course will investigate how knowledge of this controversial past can offer a framework for understanding current discussions about race and ethnicity.\nPlease note: The lectures of this course are in English. If there is only one seminar group, discussions will also be entirely in English. \nbody { font-size: 9pt;",

  "Please note that this course is offered at the Amsterdam Institute for Advanced Metropolitan Solutions in Amsterdam. Students who are not studying the master MADE but who would like to participate in this course should contact the course coordinator prior to registration.<br/><br/>The innovator's course enables students to use, contrast, discuss and integrate the many contemporary methodological and conceptual approaches to engage with metropolitan problems and potential solutions. This course complements the Metropolitan Challenges course. Students are introduced to the broad scope of human actors, ranging from civil servants, public sector professionals, entrepreneurs, engineers, to pro-active citizens, and can relate them to a variety of entities in the urban environment. The course discusses tools and frameworks for unravelling the complex metropolitan challenges, and presents approaches from different areas of knowledge dealing with metropolitan problems. These areas of knowledge are socio-technical analysis and design engineering, primarily related to urban studies, and humanities. Teaching methods include a mix of short lectures, practical workshops, and individual exercises for specific case locations in Amsterdam. Students experience the various approaches by investigating related actors and entities. They report on findings in specific case locations in Amsterdam from the point of innovation, and get acquainted with metropolitan interventions that improve or even optimise intermediaries between all actors and entities.<br/>Contemporary metropolitan regions face a variety of complex challenges that concern large numbers of stakeholders. Metropolitan challenges often have several dimensions: cultural, political, technical and aesthetic, to cite but a few. Those challenges cannot be addressed by planners, engineers and designers alone, as they require engagement with a multiplicity of perspectives necessary to understand and tackle all the dimensions involved.  For any actor working to contribute to advanced metropolitan solutions, it becomes crucial to be able to understand, communicate and to co-operate with other actors in order to integrate their knowledge about issues at hand and to understand different (and often conflicting) objectives. Awareness of this context, as well as the implicit and explicit values and cultural norms operating in a specific place, are essential to achieve suitable solutions. The course includes meta-discussions, namely on the value and role of urban theories in metropolitan innovation commonly present in different communities of knowledge and in large groups of people working together. It does so by promoting a discussion on metropolitan challenges and the theoretical and practical frameworks and tools being used by different disciplines, via interactive lectures and student workshops evaluating and acting on the issues being treated in the Metropolitan Challenges Course.",

The course deals with the dynamics of genetic variation, by evaluating the effect of and the equilibrium between mutation, natural selection, genetic drift and migration. Furthermore, it deals with the translation of genotypic variation to phenotypic variation in interaction with environmental variation. Understanding the dynamics of genetic variation, and its translation to a phenotype, is not only important for understanding past and predicting future evolutionary change, but also for its relationship to biodiversity. Furthermore, population and quantitative genetic insights are essential for plant and animal breeders to exploit genetic variation.<br/>Topics covered in this course are genetic variation and the evolution of gene frequency; multi-locus genetics and linkage disequilibrium; the effects of mutation, selection, drift, migration and inbreeding in relation to population structure; polygenic inheritance, heritability and the evolution of quantitative traits; genotype by environment interaction and environmental sensitivity; conservation genetics and the genetic management of small populations; using DNA sequence data to population processes, such as selective sweeps, genetic bottlenecks, genetic differentiation and divergence dates; and the interpretation of results from genetic analyses of populations.</p>",

  "This course studies hydrogeological systems, which are three-dimensional distributions of aquifers, semi-permeable and impermeable layers consisting of unconsolidated and hard rocks bounded by natural hydrogeological boundaries. The systems have a characteristic groundwater flow (magnitude and chemical composition). Hydrogeological systems are evaluated in the context of water resources assessment-environmental protection, and land and water use planning.\r<br/>The course covers subjects, such as, hydraulic properties of different flow media, types of saturated flow, hydrochemistry, isotope hydrology, hydrogeological systems in different environments both with unconsolidated and hard rocks, groundwater occurrence in regions with extreme climates (permafrost and (semi-)arid regions). The student learns how to perceive regional hydrogeological research.\r<br/>Besides lectures (50%), the students have to compile a conceptual model of a hydrogeological system in the field (Ardennes, Belgium), and to develop groundwater models for hydrogeological systems (computer practical).",

Most importantly, how do we constructively assess previous research, in order to investigate old research problems with new questions?\r<br/>The main focus of this course, therefore, is on the logical application of the methods students have learned previously, to design new research that demonstrates the ability to reflect on the overall theoretical and methodological context of a research project and choose an appropriate approach based on how these are connected to each other.

  "This course addresses the global/local nexus in the production, consumption and use of landscapes in the world today. It examines the ways in which different (legacies of) planning and design cultures and everyday life practices produce different types of what may be referred to as global (or globalising) landscapes, and the ways in which the valuation, production and consumption of these global landscapes as a form of economic, socio-cultural, and political capital can play a role in planning and design practices, with implications for societies in the present and for the future. While discussing recent theories adopted in (cultural) geography, sociology and (development) economics, the course will focus on the understanding of practices and processes in which planning and design can be played out differently with varied impacts. Case studies of global/globalising landscapes drawn from all over the world will play a central role in this course and will represent the veritable 'laboratories' where the students will be able to test out and critically approach the theories. Some of the themes explored in this course include, among others, the relationships between these landscapes and evolving notions of global cities, heritage, international trade and policy, identity formation, refugee geographies, global health, human-animal relations and conservation. The implications of each of these themes for the tasks of landscape architecture and spatial planning will be explicitly made throughout the course.",

  "<p>Decisions made by rural households to secure their livelihood are central to understanding many of the key issues of international development studies. Most available approaches only provide a partial understanding of these decisions, partly due to inevitable simplification of factors taken into account. This is reinforced by strict disciplinary approaches used in the analyses. The aim of this course is to increase the awareness of the strengths and weaknesses of current approaches for analysing these decisions and those factors that must be taken into account for a real understanding of livelihood strategies, acknowledging the interactions within and between rural households and with agrarian policies. In particular, the course is designed to enhance the understanding of the complementarity of (micro-)economic and sociological / anthropological approaches to rural households and their livelihood strategies. These different perspectives of households and their livelihoods have implications and consequences for the formulation of policy and for the empirical research undertaken to support policy-making. These implications will also be discussed during the course.</p>",

Resistance breeding focuses on the use of genetic resources for improving plant defence against stress factors. Breeding for biotic stress resistance addresses with defence mechanisms and strategies that protect host plants against pests and pathogens, inheritance of resistance genes, and durable effectiveness of resistance genes. Abiotic stress is caused by environmental factors (a.o. temperature, water, nutrients, minerals). Breeding for abiotic stress resistance and tolerance to such factors addresses concepts such as adaptability and stability of crop plants, mechanisms of stress tolerance and phenotyping for selection, genotype by environment interaction and selection in multi-environment trials. Differences between plant genotypes and assessment of the importance of these effects can be quantified in experiments with appropriate experimental designs and using statistical analysis of the collected data. <br/>Quality breeding is mainly directed at improving plant compounds like carbohydrates, proteins, vegetable fats and oils, fibres and secondary metabolites, that are all synthesized in metabolic pathways. Breeding objectives include improved product quality (e.g. taste, shelf life), enhanced production of flavours, fragrances and health-supporting components, absence of allergens and other undesirable compounds and improvement of processing characteristics of plant raw materials.</p>",

  "This course focuses on current dilemmas in global food safety and food security with a particular emphasis on the control of plant diseases, pests, and weeds. For example, despite major efforts to cultivate food crops without the application of pesticides, most of the global food production is still depending on chemical control of plant diseases and pests. Some experts even claim that it will be impossible to feed the world without the use of chemical control. This course discusses different aspects of chemical control of plant diseases and pests, including factors affecting the efficacy active ingredients of pesticides as well as their impact on the environment and human health. Genetic engineering is often portrayed as a strategy to reduce our dependency on pesticides in the control of plant pathogens and pests in food production. Recent genetic engineering strategies for the control of plant diseases and pests will be discussed to give an overview of the merits of each strategy and their implications for food safety and food security. The implementation of new technologies is dependent on the degree of public acceptance.

  "Various risks, such as production risk from weather, pests, diseases or contaminations, institutional risk, human risk, price and market risks are inescapable factors in food supply chains. These risks have to be managed to avoid undesired consequences for individual firms in food supply chains and for society and the economy at large. As the nature and consequences of risk evolve over time, risk management reflects a continuous adaptive process. For any organization within a food supply chain -  whether a large corporation, a government institution, or a family farm -  this process needs to be integrated into their decision making procedures to rationalize choice in an uncertain world.<br>\r<br/>This course provides a theoretical basis as well as practical experience on how risk needs to be accounted for within the decision making process. By means of lectures students will become familiar with the concept of rational choice and the theoretical principles of probability and risk preferences as well as methods to include risk within evaluations of decision alternatives. Students will apply these concepts and techniques by constructing their own decision support models during computer practicals. By various exercises, students will explore how the use of models improves the decision making process by structuring the decision problem, incorporating subjective probabilities as a way to portray risk, measuring outcomes in a way consistent with attitudes towards risk and understanding the value of information. During a concluding case study, students will act as assessors of risks from the perspective of the various stakeholders within a food supply chain (e.g. farmers, wholesalers, processors, distributors, retailers). Given a specified decision problem (viz. how to control a bacterial contamination within the chain), students will have to evaluate alternative options on behalf of the concerned stakeholders.",

See Academic Year (http://www.wur.nl/en/Education-Programmes/Current-Students/Agenda-Calendar-Academic-Year.htm) -> Registration for Courses. <br>Upon harvest plants, or parts of plants, are removed from the natural sources of water, nutrients and light that sustained their previous growth and development. This results in changes in the product that alter its value, usually decreasing it. The changes arising from the act of harvesting are superimposed on other changes that are independent of harvest that likewise have an effect on product value. Alterations in the product that reduce its value are ideally avoided. Post-harvest physiology seeks to understand the physical and physiological basis of the changes that occur in products post-harvest so as to control and augment positive changes while preventing or diminishing negative changes. As well as deepening the understanding of basic physiological processes such as respiration, membrane physiology etc., the course will extend the students' knowledge of physiology in to new areas dealing with specifically post-harvest features of plants and their component parts, for example ripening and senescence, modified and controlled atmospheres, ethylene physiology, and water uptake of cut flowers.<br/>Finally, we will look at the impact of novel technologies such as next generation sequencing, transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics to study the processes that happen in fruits and vegetables during post-harvest. The measurement of post-harvest quality has shifted from traditional phenomics (firmness, colour, weight, shape) to modern metabolic analyses and other high throughput approaches. We will look into the biosynthesis of natural products especially quality markers such as colour, vitamins and flavour and describe some examples of the effect of metabolic engineering on post-harvest quality.",

See for more information: https://tcs.sites.uu.nl/\nThe twentieth century was the century of democracy. Democracy had defeated and discredited all its ideological rivals : fascism, Nazism and communism. However, this sentiment of democratic optimism has of late made place for doubts and concerns about fate and future of democracy. Journalists and scholars tell us that we are stuck in a ‘democratic crisis’, marked by the rise of populist movements, fractured parliaments, a growing gap between political elites and the people, and the demise of political parties.\n \nHowever, this feeling of a democratic crisis is nothing new. Ever since the establishment of mass democracy in the aftermath of the First World War, democracy has appeared to be in constant crisis. In order to understand this paradox, this course investigates the history of twentieth-century democracy. Students learn about the threat that fascism, Nazism and communism posed to democracy in the Interwar period; the anti-system critique of social movements in the 1960s and 1970s; and the rise of populist parties in recent years. They conclude the course with an independent research paper, based on primary source material, of a key historical or current development, event, ideology, party or individual in the history of democracy since 1918.

  "Grasslands and rangelands can be defined as a type of vegetation in which grasses and forbs are dominant. However, woody species can also occur. Grasslands and rangelands belong to the most important types of natural vegetation in the world and they include the prairies, pampas, pustas, and steppes. However, there are also large areas of semi-natural and agricultural grasslands. Many of them are extensively or intensively managed by men to provide roughage for domestic ruminants. For example the dairy industry in NW Europe is largely dependent on agricultural grassland, whereas communal and private grazing lands are important sources of feed in Africa. Grassland vegetations contain species which tolerate frequent harvesting by herbivores (or mowing machines), but also trampling, selective biting, local depositions of urine and faeces, quite often in interaction with abiotic stresses such as drought or low fertility. The husbandry of grassland requires special skills and knowledge as it is different from the agronomy of arable crops: the large diversity of species present, the permanent or long-term nature of the vegetation, the frequent harvesting requiring continuous regrowth and tillering, the strong interaction between plant, soil and animal, and the long-term impact of management decisions (both under grazing and under mowing regimes) are all critical features of managed grasslands.\r<br/>During the course at least the following topics will be discussed:\r<br/>- the taxonomy and morphology of grassland species;\r<br/>- growth, development and physiology of grassland species;\r<br/>- grassland management, including aspects of grazing methods, botanical composition, soil quality, carbon sequestration, soil water and nutrient supply;\r<br/>- nutrition of ruminants, forage quality, forage conservation and feeding systems;\r<br/>- grass breeding, variety selection and seed production; \r<br/>- plant species diversity and productivity of semi-natural grasslands;\r<br/>- sports field turfgrass.\r<br/>Moreover, selected topics will be highlighted through group-wise case studies and excursions.",

  "Development Studies shifted significantly the last 50 years as a result of broader societal and scientific transformations. Initially comprising development economics and sociology, it now also includes anthropology, political science, communication and innovation studies, and science, technology and society studies. In Wageningen, together these disciplines focus on social transformation processes related to livelihoods, agro-food networks and the environment. \r<br/>This common course of the Master International Development Studies (MID) gives insight in the paradigm shifts that have occurred in Development Studies. It adopts a diachronic approach, focusing on 'modernization' (from the post-WWII to the early 1970s), 'globalization' (from the mid-1970s to the beginning of the new Millennium), and the contemporary concern with sustainability and global governance processes. What these periods have in common is the intense competition between co-existing development paradigms. By studying and exploring the way in which these paradigms (and their underlying conceptual apparatuses) gradually changed, this common course provides a critical grounding of the field of Development Studies.",

  "Landscape engineering concerns the application of both scientific and engineering knowledge to plan and/or design well-functioning physical environments. Interrelating natural and social processes of the landscape form the basis for well-considered choices concerning landscape design and planning. As such, landscape engineering considers a wide range of measures on different scales, from the level of regional and local land use organization (i.e. macro-scale), urban district and neighbourhood (i.e. meso-scale) to the level of building materials and tree species (i.e. micro-scale). It offers an introduction on the technical aspects to come to these process-oriented decisions in landscape planning and design. This knowledge enables students to develop functional and feasible landscape interventions. This course provides the students with qualitative and quantitative data on key categories in landscape engineering to adapt the physical space to become more suitable to future land use. Knowledge on the use of physical spaces, soil, water, vegetation and built elements will be considered as tools that help to materialize state of the art design and planning challenges.\r<br/>The lectures focus on the technical conditions, opportunities and restrictions of contemporary landscape construction and organization. This should enable students to facilitate and integrate landscape developments on different scale levels. Students will be challenged to apply this information in practical exercises for actual landscape transformations in rural and (peri-)urban situations on macro-, meso- and micro-scale.\r<br/>IPC-day\r<br/>The IPC-day is an obligatory part of the course.

  "The course deals with the ecological functioning of trees and forests. Main emphasis will be put on the way trees grow, and how this is influenced by their environment. We will look at the basic anatomical, morphological and physiological features that determine tree growth and tree form.

  "<p>Feminism perhaps is the most misunderstood term in our times. It is often related with turning women against men. It may not be uncommon to find men refusing to be called feminist because they fear acknowledging so will compromise their masculinity. And women on the other hand worry that being called a feminist may be interpreted as a man-hater. What is feminism exactly? Simply put, feminism is about the relationship between two genders and a movement to end gender-based and other forms of oppression and discrimination. It is as much about women as about men. </p><p class=\"Body\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: windowtext;\">Feminism is understood as the movement to end women's oppression and discrimination. In this simple definition of feminism are two most complex terms. &#34;What is a woman?&#34; and how source of oppression -- economic and cultural -- is a matter of justice. Simon de Beauvoir's iconic line &#34;One is not born but rather becomes a woman&#34; is routinely invoked in feminist studies to distinguish between sex as biological (with which one is born) and gender as social or cultural (with which one is made) category</span>. This course will begin with (briefly) introducing key points in feminist studies that have questioned such sex/gender distinction and reframed the relationship between biology and culture. The second most important question feminist studies have been grappling with is: how should women's oppression or discrimination be ended/addressed? Is redistribution of economic resources the answer to end women's subordination? Or, cultural recognition of their distinct position in society will end discriminating practices? The course will introduce key ideas on how gender is performed on the intersection of economy and culture. Lastly, the course will briefly introduce key points in the third such pioneering debate in feminist studies -- is knowledge gendered? Do women scientists, professionals, or farmers' knowledge of nature is different from their male counterparts? </p><p>The course will address the following questions. 1) <span style=\"text-align: justify;\">How and why oppression of women relate to domination and exploitation of nature? 2) </span><span style=\"text-align: justify;\">How do this relationship manifest in use and management of natural resource? 3)</span><span style=\"text-align: justify;\"> </span><span style=\"text-align: justify;\">How women's knowledge of their environment (climate, forests, land and water) is borne from their distinct place in society and daily experiences as women? 4) </span><span style=\"text-align: justify;\">How failure to understand the activities that women engage with makes them invisible as users and managers of natural resources? </span></p><p></p><p>In the first week of the course the key concepts in feminists studies are introduced and discussed. The second and third weeks involve applied discussions and a number of guest lectures, including tutorials involving group presentations. Intensive study and review of recommended literature continues throughout the course. A skills-training writing workshop in the last week helps students to learn how to choose researchable topic, how to develop research questions and methodology, and how to frame and present an academic essay.   </p><p></p><p></p><p></p>",

Thereto students learn to work with a meteorological workstation and basic Python scripts. Furthermore, students analyse the structure of weather systems on the synoptic scale and mesoscale and apply theory to estimate the magnitude of atmospheric quantities. Subsequently, this course also deals with the analysis and interpretation of model output leading to weather forecasting, as weather models have become a vital element therein. Thereafter, the course addresses the final step in the forecast cycle, i.e.  how to effectively communicate the weather forecast to different customers and media. Finally, a number of meteorological and/or climatological research centres in Germany are visited in order to gain insight into weather forecasting practices, current research and job opportunities in this field. <br/>For planning and logistics, students should register for this course no later than December 15.<br/></p>",

  "<p>Analysis of components in food materials is important for research, as well as for quality control, and to trace the origin of food materials. In each of these applications, the major issue is to be sure that you actually analyse those and only those compounds on which you need information. Since food products typically have a very heterogeneous composition (different classes of components, but also variants of the same molecules) the identification and quantification of specific compounds is often not straightforward. In this course, the student will learn a range of techniques that are used for analysis of pesticides, toxins, additives, biofunctionals and markers for authenticity and traceability in dynamic heterogeneous materials as food products. The basics of these techniques will be explained, as well as the applications, and examples how these are used in industry (quality assurance / quality control), or in academic research.<br/>The analysis techniques discussed in this course are chromatography, mass spectrometry, fingerprinting, isotope analysis, chemometrics and NMR. Furthermore biochemical analysis techniques are discussed as bio(chemical) -assays, immune-assays and PCR. The methods discussed are applicable in food research and development, tracing and tracking, authenticity, allergens, bio-functionality and chemical food safety. Examples such as authenticity issues with parmesan cheese, health claims, pesticides, marine biotoxins and dioxins are part of the course.

  "<p>The objective of the course is to provide students with a multidisciplinary theoretical basis on how companies create value through technology management and business model innovation and to learn to critically evaluate innovation theories. <br/>Social and technological developments create opportunities for new innovations that go beyond simple product innovations and that affect entire business models.

Such business model innovations have brought structural changes to the mature markets that they entered, have changed the lives of their customers, and/or the sustainability of the industry. This course will make clear that technological change and (business model) innovation are among the most difficult to understand phenomena in our modern economy. While trying to understand these phenomena from a wide range of theories coming from different business disciplines, students will develop a deep understanding of a particular business model innovation and draw lessons from it.

  "Besides a correct design or layout, good control systems are essential to guarantee that production systems operate and produce according the desired specifications. This course gives an introduction to classical control engineering approaches and discusses the standard methods and tools that are usually applied. The methods discussed in the course have a very wide application area. Examples are greenhouse climate, bioreactors, food production, robotics, environmental systems etc. This makes that the course fits in the curricula of several studies.<br/>The course starts with a refresher on dynamic models of systems represented by differential equations. These differential equations will be solved by transformation to the Laplace domain. The system representation in the Laplace domain by transfer functions offers several new possibilities to interpret and to analyze the characteristics of systems and to design controllers.<br/>Classical control is discussed and analyzed for the PID controller family. Controller tuning, stability and performance are central items to qualify the controllers, and methods to find these qualifications are introduced (response times, pole placement, root-locus and frequency response). At the end of the course the use of control systems is extended from single-input single-output systems to the more complex multiple-input multiple-output systems.<br/>During the course theory will be explained by examples from practice, exercising problems, working on a design case and a computer practical on controller tuning as it would be done in a practical situation.",

  "Global water scarcity necessitates the reuse of domestic, agricultural and industrial wastewaters. To achieve this objective, in many cases advanced treatment concepts are required, in which biological treatment processes for removal and recovery of bulk contaminants are supported by physical-chemical treatment methods for removal of trace and/or non-biodegradable contaminants. In this course the emphasis is on these physical-chemical treatment technologies. Membrane treatment, advanced oxidation processes and drinking water purification are only some examples of the technologies that are explained. This course also deals with the background knowledge required for reactor design, optimization of reactor performance and scaling up. This includes physical transport phenomena, chemical and physical equilibria, chemical reaction kinetics, phase separation, electrochemistry and colloid chemistry. A number of realistic cases are described, which illustrate how, based on wastewater characteristics and effluent requirements, the appropriate unit processes can be selected and designed.",

  "This course elaborates on the basic mechanisms of development that were introduced in ‘Mechanisms of development’ (MOB-20803). Although plants and animals have developed separately for about 1.6 billion years, an ‘overall logic of development’ can be found when plant and animals are compared. In the present course we will try to deepen our understanding of the mechanisms that underly plant and animal development. We will use several of the mathematical tools that were introduced in ‘Modeling biological systems’ (EZO-23306) to derive a more quantitative description of several developmental mechanisms. Such a quantitative description is required to properly interpret the possibilities and impossibilities of the mechanisms underlying plant and animal development. <br/><br/>The course is designed around six major themes. The first theme is from polarization to gradient formation. In early development, axes are determined in an initially mostly symmetrical embryo. This polarization (or symmetry-breaking) leads to the formation of gradients of signalling molecules. Concentration gradients of these morphogens are crucial to a proper interpretation of the signal. During this theme we will elaborate on the determination of the dorsoventral axis in Drosophila, which we first saw in ‘Mechanisms of development’. Furthermore, we will see how an auxin gradient is formed and maintained during plant root growth.<br/><br/>The second theme is gene network inference. Animal and plant development needs to be regulated, and genes are the producers of regulators such as transcription factors and morphogens. Genes do not function individually, but are part of networks. These networks often have a modular structure and regulate a specific part of development. In this second theme we will see how networks are formed and maintained and we will see examples of how networks regulate development. <br/><br/>Polar growth mechanisms comprise the third theme. We met polarity already in ‘Mechanisms of development’, when we discussed the early steps of Xenopus development. The Xenopus egg showed a clear polarity with a heavily pigmented animal pole and a clear vegetal pole. During this course we will focus on polarity later in development, and in association with cell movement in a particular direction (i.e. polar growth). Gene networks and gradients play an important role in the regulation of the cell’s actin skeleton. We will see how keratocytes are polarized and how they are able to move. In plants, we will try to understand tip growth in roots and pollen tubes.<br/><br/>In the fourth theme dynamic control of pattern formation, we will combine gradients, gene networks, and polarity to understand how detailed patterns are dynamically controlled. We will discover that the mechanism of lateral inhibition plays a crucial role in both the formation of somites in animals, and the formation of root hairs in plants. It will further become clear that communication between cells is essential to pattern formation. The fifth theme is self-organising multicellularity. In this theme you will be introduced to the slime molds, such as Dictyostelium discoideum. This organism provides an interesting example of multicellular organization derived from unicellular organisms in a single life cycle. Plants and animals have also made the transition from unicellular to multicellular organism, albeit over millions of years of evolution. We will see how the previous hemes integrate to explain the social reproductive cycle of Dictyostelium.<br/><br/>The sixth theme is regeneration. Regeneration is a process that is still poorly understood, but it integrates many of the aspects treated in the previous themes as well as many of the topics from ‘Mechanisms of development’. We will try to understand the current state of knowledge and possibly formulate hypothesis on how and why this intriguing phenomenon is so evidently working in amphibians and not in mammals. <br/><br/>The general setup of the course is that each theme is studied by two special topics. Where possible, one of the topics relates to plant development and the other to animal development. The general aspects of each theme and the special topics will be introduced during the lectures. We will end each week with the reading and discussion of a (recent) paper that summarizes the major points of that particular week.",

  "<p><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">This course aims at providing knowledge and understanding on the functioning and resilience of marine animals in a changing environment. In this course we will focus on the mechanisms of adaptation of marine animal to environmental changes. We will then use this understanding of ecological mechanisms to explore the concept and implementation of Building with Nature (BwN). BwN is the synergistic combination of coastal engineering and ecological processes. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\"><br/> Adaptation involves different ecological and evolutionary time-scales, from short-term plasticity to long-term adaptation. A multi-level approach will be taken: adaptation at the organism level (eco-physiology, recruitment and early life-stage development), at the population level (population genomics/genetics) and at the ecosystem level (shifts in community composition). Latest developments in the field will be used to illustrate ecological concepts in multiple ecosystems, including temperate, tropical and deep sea systems. Understanding of these concepts is vital to assess the adaptive responses of animals and ecosystems to various influences and human activities and the opportunities for management of a.o. biodiversity, invasive species or impacts of climate change. Techniques that are used in marine animal ecology will be discussed and practiced. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\"><br/> Building with Nature is an approach in which local conditions are taken into account during an early planning stage of coastal engineering, to be able to make use of services provided by engineering species and additional positive effects of local ecosystem functions. The local conditions include the natural physical processes, ecology and social-economic aspects. By not just building in nature but also <u>with</u> nature, additional benefits can be created for nature, recreation and the local economy while preventing adverse effects. Current developments will be included such as the implementation of bivalve reefs for coastal protection and marine production and dedicated coral reef building and restoration that enhance biodiversity and provide several ecosystem services for local communities. To experience the complexity of building with nature projects, the students will develop a conceptual design, including physical, ecological, economic, and governance aspects, the students will learn to quantify the engineering functions (e.g. sediment capture, wave energy dissipation) and other ecosystem services of Building with Nature designs. Students will integrate disciplinary aspects of a Building with Nature design (e.g. physical, ecological, economic, and governance aspects) by making a knowledge clip about an existing or a new Building with Nature project. <br/> We expect active participation from the students during interactive lectures, tutorials, practicals and monitoring activities at an oyster reef in the Netherlands. During, the course, selected trending topics in marine animal ecology will be presented. Each student has to define a relevant research question and write a short research proposal.

As a consequence they require complex media and due to lack of a cell wall are sensitive to shear. This has major consequences for media development and the design and scale-up of bioreactors. This course aims to give insight into the consequences of the specific biological features of animal cells on the design and scale-up of production processes for animal cells.",

  "<p>Food quality management encompasses the management of food production systems to realise and ensure product quality in food supply chains. Food quality issues are commonly rooted in multiple systems such as the technical food production, the quality and safety management system, the supply chain, and safety governance system. Analysis of complex issues in food quality management requires an interdisciplinary research approach, the so-called techno-managerial approach. <br/>The research principles course II (FQD 64806) builds further on the previous course FQD-64306; the combined courses are the academic master course for MSc students in Food Quality Management. In the research principles course II, you will use the techno-managerial research approach in designing and applying research methods for empirical research (data collection and analysis) and in developing possible solutions on likely technological and managerial causal factors underlying the complex quality problem.<br/>Major topics addressed in this course include:<br/>- operationalising research framework (make it measurable);<br/>- designing empirical study;<br/>- developing research methods for data collection (expert interview, literature analysis empirical studies, survey);<br/>- data collection principles;<br/>- qualitative data analysis;<br/>- developing technological and managerial  intervention strategies (solutions);<br/>- scientific reporting;<br/>- food quality management in research and practice.<br/></p>",

  "<p>Note: This course can not be combined in an individual programme with LUP-37312 Studio Strategic Planning.<br/></p><p>In this course the students will become familiar with theory and methodology of planning for urban quality of life. The course activities include theory lectures and a practical group assignment. The theory lectures focus on selected aspects of quality of life relevant for urban and regional planning. The group assignment focuses on analysing and designing the regional spatial organization and building spatial scenarios for the future spatial development of a region. The assignment and related instruction lectures will familiarize the students with methods for prospective and projective scenario study.<br/>The methods and techniques will be applied in the context of an urban region in the Netherlands. The overall planning task for the assignment is to develop an integrated spatial vision, scenarios and strategies for the region for the long term (30 years) that can support the discussion about the future development of the region. The study area allows exploring the relationships between the urban fabric and the diversity of human activities. However, the study area is complex and we do not expect students to develop a comprehensive view of all the problems and developments in the area within the time constraints of this course. The assignment addresses some selected topics, while each group can choose their own focal issues. The main emphasis is on practicing with methods and techniques for analysing and designing the spatial organization and building scenarios. The concepts for analyzing and designing the spatial organization of the area will be provided in theory and instruction lectures. The students will learn to deal with the uncertainties that are evident when building scenarios and visions for the future spatial development of a region. The assignments will familiarize students with spatial planning issues at different scale levels and time horizons. A study trip to the area will help the student to understand the context of the issues at hand.<br/>The group assignments will be introduced in instruction lectures and a course manual. The related theory is being introduced in theory lectures and selected papers. The practical assignments are presented in four subsequent steps: 1) Analysing the present situation of the area, 2) Trend analysis and building external scenarios, 3) Designing a vision of the future situation of the area and 4) A SWOT analysis to arrive at policy strategies.</p>",

  "<p>Spatial planning inherently is an activity that is targeted at the future use of spatial resources. Spatial resources are scarce. This scarcity is not only environmentally determined, but to a large extend a result of a political process. Spatial planning creates or alleviates scarcity of land by intervening in the allocation and distribution of land. It thereby intervenes with private property rights - i.e. granting, changing, or taking them. Whether scarcity is good or bad depends on the perspective and the policy goals. Once these goals are set, one of the greatest challenges spatial planning is its implementation. This course focuses not on the policy goals, but on its implementation (the policy goals will be discussed in ‘LUP-32806 Political Dilemmas of Spatial Planning’). <br/>Implementing spatial policy is at the very core of spatial planning as a discipline. For the implementation of spatial planning objectives there are different instruments of land policy at the disposal of planners to deal with property rights of landowners. The instruments reach from tax incentives land readjustment, pre-emptive right, or even expropriation. The selection of such instruments of land policy is often presented in a functionalist approach as if it depended merely on technical choices. However, instruments are embedded in a political process. They correspond to specific interpretations of the role of the state and/or its private partners. Which instruments are appropriate, thus largely depends on the context in which they are used. Thereby planners need to find the right balance between flexibility and legal certainty.<br/>In an increasingly dynamic society that is reinventing itself continuously, it is vital for planners to understand this context of society &amp; innovation. This course discusses how the public actors strategically can use certain instruments of land policy in such a context.</p>",

This is achieved with intense training on preparing an academic paper on instruments of land policy (including supporting planning objectives with relevant facts and figures obtained from literature and translating identified research questions into a detailed research plan based on interdisciplinary literature; structure and compose a comprehensive and original planning advice and identify the conflicting stakes and ethical implications involved in, and prompted by, different planning approaches and the envisioned scenarios). The strategic use of instruments also relates to the complex and dynamic nature of the contemporary challenges at various scales of intervention (local, regional, national and international).

  "The aim of the course is to introduce students to interdisciplinary thinking. This course focuses on two stages of interdisciplinary thinking: disciplinary grounding and perspective taking:\n1. Disciplinary grounding involves having a basic knowledge and understanding of the four PPE disciplines as well as ways in which their knowledge is constructed, validated and communicated.\nThis implies:\n \n- Knowing which phenomena are being studied in the four disciplines (basic disciplinary concepts, theories, assumptions);\n \n- Understanding the basic assumptions of these disciplines (for example assumptions about the rationality of human beings), the epistemology (the way of testing any belief or assertion of truth), its methods and ways of validation, and genres of communication (e.g. a historical narrative, a law, a research paper);\n \n- Assessing which disciplines might best inform the particular question or issue, and what aspect of each of these disciplines are used (e.g. particular concepts, methods or forms of communication).\n2. Perspective taking involves analyzing the problem from the standpoint of each interested discipline and identifying their commonalities and differences. It also encompasses an attitude of open mindedness to- and valuing of different perspectives, and the willingness to reflect on one’s own biases and assumptions. \nThis includes:\n \n- Appreciating different (personal and disciplinary) perspectives, and becoming aware of one’s own biases and assumptions; \n \n- Framing a (research) question that justifies an interdisciplinary approach;\n \n- Considering the object of study from more than one disciplinary perspective and using sources from two or more disciplines;\nEvaluating and addressing the limitations and the value of the disciplinary perspectives. \nPlease be aware that there are no regular meetings for this course; it requires active participation in step-back weeks, active participation in interdisciplinary assignments within the courses, and self-study only.",

Were their ideal visions of Europe based on a presumed cultural unity based on Roman and Christian foundations, from which other cultures were excluded? Or did they instead highlight the cultural diversity of Europe? How were they planning to translate these visions into a political reality: through a federation, a confederation or a unitary state? How did they deal with the tension between national sovereignty and European unity; and with the German Question, the integration of that powerful and centrally located country into the European state system? In this course you will examine their effect on the political-institutional developments in the twentieth century. In group discussions you will discuss the ways in which these historically laden concepts continue to exert influence on contemporary political debates.\n \nNote!

  "A business success depends on its ability to supply a product or service to meet demand. But the marketplace is constantly evolving. Consider for instance the influence of the developments within public opinions and consumer preferences, laws and regulations and market forces. All these developments influence the continuity and profitability of a business. Businesses that are willing to survive must therefore react effectively to these changes in their environment.\r<br/>This course provides an outline of the decision making process or the business planning, managers within the food supply chain apply to respond to changes. It starts with an exploration and analysis of the business' environment to support decisions on a strategic (long term) level. Consequently, various elements of effective decision making are discussed as the development of a marketing plan, an investment- and financing plan, an organisation plan and an implementation plan. Students will apply the presented elements and techniques by constructing a business plan of a business within the food supply chain.",

The course is not delivered at Wageningen University, however, but at Breda University of Applied Sciences. You can register for the course by contacting the course coordinator before the start of the course. The schedule for the academic year at Breda University of Applied Sciences differs from the schedule of Wageningen University. The periods mentioned are the periods of Wageningen University.<br/><br/>Tourism is an intensely geographical phenomenon; it involves the movement of millions of travellers across the world, seeking tourist experiences on both a local and global scale. Tourism creates distinctive relationships between people and places that have a range of economic, social, cultural and environmental impacts. Geography is a discipline that seeks to interpret and understand our changing world - a world in which geographical patterns are constantly reworked by powerful forces of change. These forces include new patterns of economic production and consumption, new forms of mass movements, globalisation, and the increasing time-space compression of new media, but also environmental changes brought on by the impact of human activities on the earth. Tourism is one of these major forces of change, with many places and landscapes across the globe being transformed by tourist development. Both socio- cultural and natural phenomena influence and are influenced by the growing spatial impact of tourism.  Geography is articulated into two main branches: human geography and physical geography. The plural, geographies, is used in the course title to express the diversity of perspectives that the discipline of geography can offer the study of tourism. The overall goal of this course is to introduce the basics of geography as understood by human and physical geographers, and to show how an integrated perspective between the social sciences and the environmental sciences is of great help to understand the actual geographies of tourism. The lectures introduce concepts and models that are then further worked out through empirical cases and technical methods addressing actual tourism practices during the workshops and excursion.</p>",

Politics is about the interaction between actors with different levels of influence, and competing visions of the world. Interrogating politics allows for a deeper study of conflict, trade-offs, and power dynamics, such as those found in international development. <br/>In this course, we pay particular attention to interventions in international development and to the mobilization of resources therein. In so doing, this course introduces students to a number of key concepts in political sociology and anthropology, focussing on concepts that seek to challenge common-sense understandings of the world.

  "This course introduces students to environmental systems analysis. We focus on its analytical tools to assess climate change impacts and adaptation and apply these tools to a climate change impacts problem. \r<br/>Environmental problems are usually not easily solved, because of their complex multidisciplinary nature and the many stakeholders involved. Analysing such complex problems requires an approach integrating multiple scientific disciplines (from natural as well as social sciences), several environmental compartments (terrestrial, aquatic and atmosphere; including biotic and abiotic aspects), various temporal and geographical scales, and different system perspectives (e.g. from a regional or a flow perspective). \r<br/>One of those complex environmental problems is climate change. You have all heard of climate change and know already a bit about it. You have for instance learned about and calculated the anthropogenic greenhouse effect in the Air Quality course. But do you actually know the details of climate change consequences in different regions? And do you know which tools are used to study climate change, its impacts and solutions? In this course we will study climate change further and introduce and apply the tools used to assess climate change impacts and adaptation.\r<br/>This course teaches an environmental systems approach, the so-called flexible step approach, for analysing complex environmental problems such as climate change. This approach provides a general framework to consider multiple aspects in exploring alternative solutions for complex environmental problems. Different analytical tools exist that can be used in environmental systems analysis. A number of these tools will be addressed, but the focus is on the tools conceptual model, regression model and scenario analysis that together can be used to assess climate change impacts and adaptation. \r<br/>The flexible step approach and climate change impact and adaptation assessment will be taught in lectures, practiced in a practical and applied in an assignment. In the assignment you will study a selected climate change impact problem linked to the study fields of staff of the environmental systems analysis groups. These include for instance health, tourism, ecosystem services and nutrients. Datasets will be provided and you will set up a conceptual model, develop a statistical regression model, apply scenario analysis, study adaptation options and communicate your results.",

  "Quality and safety are essential conditions to each industry, company or establishment dealing with agricultural and food products. Different systems have been developed to assure the quality and safety of the foods produced. These foods are not made from start to finish in one company, but they are made in a food production chain, which involves many steps from primary production at the farm to consumer. Food quality assurance systems have therefore been developed to take into account the complete food production chain. This course will give an introduction into the principles behind effective operational quality systems in these complex food production chains.<br/>Major theoretical topics of the course include:<br/>- relation between food properties and quality attributes in the food production chain;<br/>- traceability of food products in the food production chain;<br/>- basic principles of operations management;<br/>- principles of major technological tools, methods, techniques in quality control and inspection;<br/>- introduction to major quality assurance standards.<br/>In addition, the course contains assignments related to these 4 topics.

  "Environmental psychology studies the interactions between humans and the environment from a psychological point of view, that is, taking the individual mind as the primary unit of analysis. This course focuses on the reciprocal relationships between humans and those built and natural environments that are most relevant for the environmental sciences: nature, wildlife, landscape and places, and the environment in general. These relationships are rooted in biological as well as cultural and personal mechanisms. The course introduces the history and scope of the field of environmental psychology and describes the advantages and disadvantages of the methods used to derive scientific knowledge of environment and behaviour relationships. The students learn how natural and built environments are perceived and appreciated, how interacting with nature may benefit humans psychologically and physiologically, how people develop a sense of place, how cognitions and emotions towards wildlife are constituted, and how people may built up general images of nature and the environment. The course presents major theories such as, the working of perception and emotion, memory, conscious and unconscious psychological processing, arousal theory, the cognitive hierarchy model, and the psychology of aesthetics. The ultimate aim of environmental psychology is to contribute to creating liveable environments by providing relevant scientific knowledge. The question of how we can use knowledge on human-environment relationships to formulate management strategies, planning strategies, and design principles for urban-rural planning, landscape architecture, and natural resources management will be discussed.",

Here we cannot simply rely on well-programmed and advanced computer software. Elementary knowledge and understanding of the underlying solution techniques is needed to apply and interpret the outcome successfully in practice. Moreover, problems in practice are often too large and/or difficult to find optimal solutions. DST pays attention to both common sense- and mathematical programming based approximation methods (e.g.  by applying aggregation-, decomposition-, or reformulation principles, and/or heuristics) to find effective solutions within a reasonable amount of time.

  "Scientific research is essential for  advancing our knowledge on biophysical and socioeconomic factors leading to land degradation or land restoration, and designing sustainable land use and management strategies. This course provides students the tools for doing land management research themselves. It gives students state-of-the-art scientific insights that deal with the fundamentals of land management and the physical environment; i.e. the interacting systems of hydrology, climate, soils and sediments on various temporal and spatial scales. Furthermore, students in this course will learn how to integrate biophysical and socioeconomic data, and apply this in fundamental research and the use of models. <br/>During the first weeks the course focuses on scientific research and practical applications related to the biophysical environment (climate, hydrology, geology, soils chemistry, soil physics and biological aspects of crops). All these factors determine available land management options and their final sustainable impact on soil and water resources, with fundamental research playing a crucial role. During these weeks methodologies for physical research will be explained and practiced. In the following weeks students will investigate the threats to sustainable land management, their biophysical and socio-economic processes involved. With the emphasis on the fundamentals of land management research and the inclusion of presentations by researchers from the SLM group, by the end of the course students will be equipped for any research project on either biophysical or socioeconomic aspects of land management.",

  "This course aims to provide insights into manifestations of power in relation to development. It focuses on both long-term political processes and global-local interactions to explain the production and reproduction of social, economic and political inequalities. The course will be organised around three themes: state, the formation of property through global capitalism and strategies of resistance. State, statehood and property reflect the most salient hegemonic forms of power-relations, whereas resistance will be discussed as a central concept to focus on counter hegemonic forms of power relations. The various ways in which political struggles entail crucial developments such as state formation, (neo-)colonialism, the rise of inter-governmental and non-governmental organizations and resistance by social movements, will be analysed. We look at these processes in the context of the rise of global capitalism and how this has manifested itself in the global economy. People's access to natural resources and the way this plays out in various fields, such as land conflict and migration, will play a central role in our analysis. \r<br/>We will examine present-day development issues by an analysis of how political actors such as local communities, states, NGOs, international, transnational and intergovernmental organizations use and produce law, policies and governance in various practices invested with power also within less institutionalized environments.",

  "Wageningen University graduates tend to enter a professional career that requires them to articulate, translate and share the knowledge they developed, and will continue to develop, in a wide range of societal contexts. Many of them will work in educational settings (e.g. in universities, colleges and vocational education and training centres) or in multi-stakeholder community and/or private sector-oriented settings where making complex scientific knowledge understandable and accessible to multiple audiences is crucial to have impact in society.  This course will enable you to develop the capacity to transfer and co-create knowledge in - depending on where you see yourself going after graduation - formal, non-formal and informal education and training settings. You will learn how to make scientific knowledge meaningful and accessible to an 'audience' of your own choosing, bearing in mind socio-cultural differences in what constitutes knowledge, teaching, learning, and the role of science in society. Particular attention will be given to sustainable development as an example of a complex and even 'wicked' problem that poses special challenges for teaching, learning, and capacity building. Sustainable development can be viewed as an urgent but 'inevitably ill-defined' topic that many Wageningen University students are engaged in, in one way or another. How do you make such a problem understandable and meaningful when there are differences within science itself as to what is going on and what needs to be done? To complicate things further, in the digital age information about sustainable development is everywhere and can be accessed by almost anyone, but whom to trust and how to make sense of it?

  "Are policy-making processes geared toward providing optimal solutions for societal problems or do societal groups use these processes to secure their interests and ideals? \nPolitics and policy-making will show that public policy process often involves both dynamics. On the one hand, policy-making processes involve actors that seek to provide knowledge to effectively achieve policy goals. On the other hand, actors struggle to attain their ideals and protect their interests during these processes. The tension between the technical interpretation of ‘public policy making as problem-solving operations’ and the political interpretation of ‘public policy making as a partisan struggle’ returns throughout the course.\nThe central objective of this course is to equip students with the knowledge to analyze the decision-making the exercise of power in public policy processes. Students are thus made aware that policy-making is, in part, a political process involving the exercise of power. The course focuses on the power of ideas, institutions, and actors in the policy-making process. Building on a theoretical foundation, examples and, if possible, practitioners will provide insights into the realities of policy-making processes. Further, students are challenged to apply theoretical insights to real-world cases..",

  "Agriculture is challenged to overcome increasing labour costs, decreasing availability of labour and increasing demands concerning precision, product quality and reduction of environmental and animal load. As can be seen in Western Europe an important solution is to replace human labour by automation in areas such as arable farming, livestock farming, and horticulture. Examples of automation are milking robots, GPS steering of tractors, autonomous vehicles and automated harvesting in greenhouse production. The design and implementation of such automated systems is expected to be at the heart of agricultural innovation the next decades.\r<br/>The guideline for this course is taken from the robotics domain and is stated as: 'Robotics is the intelligent transformation of perception into mechanical action'. To realize these transformations sensors, actuators, manipulators, vehicles, computers and decision systems, are important components. These components and how they may be applied to design automated agricultural systems constitute the contents of this course.\r<br/>The theoretical part of this course will be presented during lectures. Practical assignments concern the design, programming and control of a robot manipulator and an autonomous vehicle.",

  "People make decisions based on data. This holds for individuals, industry, governments, and scientists. In everyday life you might for example decide whether to go to class by bike or by bus, depending on your knowledge of travel time: how frequently are busses running and is a bus ride shorter than a bike ride? Industry uses data to gain insights in the interests of their customers, or how strong competitors are. Government calculates and tests what the impact of new policies is on society to decide on an effective policy. And finally, scientists use data to develop theories about the many facets of life and the universe.\n To later function properly in your everyday life and in your professional career, you should know how to derive valid and reliable conclusions based on data. To do this, you need to know among others how to collect reliable data (using experimental methods), how to analyze this data (using statistics), and how to communicate these results effectively. These results should be placed in the context of theory (and more generally: in the context of knowledge). Characteristic for AI students and professionals is that they often use computer models and computer simulations to approximate reality. However, how do you then compare a result from a simulation with data from real people? In this course you will learn this and more.\n \nExamination &amp; relationship between grading and course objectives\nExamination consists of 4 components:\n \n- All computer lab assignments are signed off in time (not graded individually)\n \n- A written exam in which theoretical knowledge is tested. The weight of this test is 50% of your final grade. The minimum grade is a 5.5.\n \n- There are periodical homework-assignments that you can hand in related to the workgroups (“werkcolleges”).\n \n- A report in the form of a short scientific article. In this report you cover among others the method of your experiment, analysis of your data, explain the structure of your model, analysis of model data, and you discuss the implications and limitations of your results. The weight of this report is 50% of your final grade. The minimum grade is a 5.5.\nIn the written exam and the (homework) assignments, you will practice statistical techniques and reporting of statistical techniques (course objectives 1 and 4). In the computer lab sessions and final report, you also practice with experimental methods, modeling, and reporting these (course objectives 2, 3, and 4).\nStructure\nThe course has three different forms of teaching.\nComputer labs Students work on a research project throughout the course. They analyze data of a psychological experiment, develop a cognitive model and test how well the cognitive model describes and explains the empirical data. The results will be written up in a final report. During the labs, students apply the knowledge that they gained during the lectures.\n \nWorkgroups (“Werkcolleges”) During the workgroups, students practice with statistical concepts from the lectures. They later also apply these concepts during the computer labs and during the final exam.\n \nPlenary lectures During the plenary lectures we will cover the necessary theoretical background to topics that you will apply and practice during the computer labs and workgroups.\n \n- The lectures by Krista Overvliet will mostly focus on methods, including explanation of the research topic (multitasking) and the development and analysis of cognitive models – with an emphasis on functional, process-oriented models. These lectures will be in Dutch, unless non-Dutch lecturers, student assistants, or students attend.\n \n- The lectures of Benjamin Rin will mostly focus on different types of statistics. This will include the difference between Bayesian and more orthodox statistics. These lectures will be in English.\n \n- Both lecturers will also touch on more general aspects of scientific research, as part of the preparation for your Bachelor thesis research. This year we will focus particularly on reading and writing of scientific reports.\n \nbody { font-size: 9pt;",

Of course, there are many more methods and techniques that you might want to apply beyond what we can cover during the course. We therefore focus on some of the basic principles, so you can apply and extend these more easily at a later time relatively independently. Throughout the course we will emphasize methods and techniques that are relevant for research and applications from an AI perspective.\nAt a more general level, this course is one of the final courses of your Bachelor's degree in Artificial Intelligence. Therefore, we will also help you to prepare for conducting your own Bachelor research project.

  "<p>Note: This course can not be combined in an individual programme with HNH-32806 Exposure Assessment in Nutrition and Health Research.<br/></p><p>This course addresses methodological aspects of exposure assessment in nutrition research. Focus is on design and analysis of evaluation studies which assess measurement error in dietary intakes. You will learn how to adjust study results from nutritional surveillance and etiological studies for these measurement errors.<br/> Nutrition research is often blamed for poor exposure assessment that might impair its usefulness. For example it has often been argued that FFQs are not useful to detect weak associations between dietary intake and health outcomes, since estimates of these associations are affected by errors in the exposure assessment. Despite their measurement errors, FFQs are commonly applied in epidemiological studies, as they are considered a feasible and cost-effective dietary assessment method. Evaluation studies (e.g. reproducibility and validation studies) can help to quantify measurement errors in dietary exposure assessment, in order to adjust research outcomes (e.g. associations between intake and health/disease or nutrient recommendations) for those errors and to adapt dietary assessment methods. Therefore such evaluation studies are essential to incorporate in nutritional research such as large cohort studies, case-control studies, surveillance studies etc. Consequently it is crucial for you as future researcher or practicing nutritional epidemiologist, to get training on the design, analyses and interpretation of studies which aim to valuate dietary assessment methods.<br/><br/>Note: This online course largely overlaps with the course HNH-32806 Exposure Assessment in Nutrition and Health Research.</p><p><br/><br/><br/></p>",

  "The course provides a broad overview of development thinking and administration since the Second World War. In the first part contemporary debates on the success and failure of development aid are reviewed from economic and anthropological/sociological perspectives. In the literature radically different political positions are adopted concerning development aid. The debate among economists is about the possibilities to combine market mechanisms with development interventions, while the debate among sociologists is about the modernist (or western) provenance of the very idea of development and its effects on Third World people. On the negative side, neo-liberal economists decry development planning as incompatible with the market (and thus as a hindrance to economic development), while so-called post-developmentalist sociologists see development projects and programs as intent on shaping the world to its own image. Pro-aid economists are positive about the possibility to promote development through appropriate projects and programs, while pro-aid sociologists insist that development can only become meaningful to local people if knowledge about their livelihoods is included. This first part of the course ends with a discussion forum in which students explain and defend these differing positions. <br/>The second part of the course has a more practical and thematic character. It starts with an appraisal exercise in which students evaluate a project and propose modifications to the original design (the Big Catch exercise). Special attention will be paid to project planning methodologies  (the project cycle and the log-frame, comprehensive, adaptive, and learning approaches), participation in development, the planning as narrative approach, and the psychoanalytical approach to projects as 'the creation and banalization of desires for development'. The proposed modifications of the Big Catch will be discussed in a plenary debate in which the best option will be chosen. Subsequently, current shifts in the international development landscape will be discussed, such as the financialization of development targeting the 'bottom of the pyramid and the rise of development/poverty capital. The course ends with a series of lectures on disaster planning and prevention in which the fantastic nature of modernist planning is queried.",

  "<p>Note: This course can not be combined in an individual programme with PCC-23303 Introductory Thermodynamics B.<br/></p><p>Thermodynamics is the science that uses the First Law (energy is conserved) and the Second Law (entropy of the universe goes to a maximum) to describe how systems change when they interact with each other or with their surroundings. Thermodynamics was originally meant to increase the efficiency of steam engines, and has nowadays a prominent place in many scientific disciplines including cosmology, physics (phase transitions), chemistry (chemical reactions) and engineering (efficiency of energy conversion). <br/>This course introduces thermodynamic concepts, including energy, enthalpy, entropy, chemical potential, Gibbs and Helmholtz energy. On the basis of the First and Second Law of thermodynamics, the equilibrium concept will be introduced and used to describe reversible and irreversible processes. The Gibbs energy has a central role in this. Given the molar Gibbs  energies of the reactants and products involved in a process, it can be deduced in what direction a process tends to go, what will be the maximum yield of a particular product and how the direction or yield for a process can be influenced by changing temperature, pressure and composition of a system.</p>",

What was the impact of those boundaries on people living in these peripheral areas and what was the relationship between the empire’s centre, Rome, and the periphery? We will dive into theoretical concepts related to boundaries and the spread of Roman culture (“romanization”) and look at various case studies.

  "<p>The landscape is a complex system characterized by numerous properties that often vary in space and time. We can learn about the functioning of a landscape by studying its properties, their variability and their relationships. This course combines thematic knowledge gained in courses on soil science, geology, geomorphology, ecology and hydrology with skills you acquired in courses in statistics, dynamic modelling and GIS. Statistical measures that characterize variability and relationships are reviewed and extended with geo-statistical measures of spatial variability. Simulation models are used to gain insight in the dynamic behaviour of landscapes and soils. Theory and methods are illustrated with real-world examples. Real-world case studies are also extensively used in the computer exercises. The course also includes a small research project involving fieldwork, laboratory analysis, and use of mechanistic models and statistical analysis. This small project addresses the description, modelling and interpretation of the spatial variation of soil pollution and its ecological effects.</p>",

  "At every moment in time, people dealing with forest and nature have to make choices about the use, management and/or conservation of forest and nature areas. They face a multitude of possibilities to choose from and need to select a course of action. The importance of the decision process is immense, as that what forest and nature eventually becomes, is a consequence of the decisions made. This course offers a deeper insight into the theoretical field of both individual and collective decision-making in forest and nature management and its practical applications. In this course the central focus will be on the analysis, understanding and application of human decision-making with regard to the use, management and conservation of nature and forests. \r<br/>This course, first and foremost, focuses on the understanding of individual and group decision-making and decision-making processes. In this course, we explore three types of decision-making, always in relation to forest and nature (the object of our course). Differences between the types of decision-making lie in the subject(s) of decision-making:\r<br/>- the simplest case, called individual decision-making, assumes a single decision-maker who makes decisions, unimpeded by other people.\r<br/>- in competitive decision-making, the situation is different from the one above in that the decision of the individual decision-maker depends on the interaction with and decisions made by other people This type of decision-making can be either cooperative (a certain decision means a win situation for both actor A and  actor B) or strategic (the gain of actor A is the loss of actor B and vice versa).\r<br/>- the third case, group decision-making, is a situation faced when individuals collectively (have to) make a choice from the alternatives available.\r<br/>Because decision-making situations differ (e.g. resource type, available information, presence of conflicting views), different types of decision situations in forest and nature management will be discussed. The possibilities and limitations of the different decision-making approaches in the different decision situations will be investigated. Different topics from forest and nature conservation will be used as examples to reflect on related theory and practice. The course will not be limited to a certain region, thus including Dutch/European/global applications and examples.\r<br/>This is a course for students with an interest in decision-making and applications for forest and nature conservation and management. Lectures are taught at an advanced level, and experientially (e.g., in-class experiments) and expect interaction and exchange between those participating in the course.",

  "<p>Our continuously growing cities and (urban) populations are highly and increasingly dependent on external supply of, often overexploited and limited, resources like water, energy, elements. Our modern cities can be characterized by their linear way of consuming high-quality resources and leaving behind waste streams and thus cannot be considered sustainable. The bio-capacities or ecological footprints of these cities and their hinterlands are largely exceeded as resources are used inefficiently as local supply, reuse and recovery potential is not in place. This course focuses on the positive impact, concepts and methodologies of a circular approach:  closing resource (water and nutrient) cycles, improving resources chains in accordance with sustainability principles by applying various and suitable technologies to achieve this in practice.<br/><br/>Based on the concept of Urban Metabolism, students are given the opportunity to critically examine and apply several conceptual frameworks that aim at closing resource cycles or making resources chains more sustainable, such as e.g. Urban Harvest Approach, New Stepped Strategy, Trias Energetica, REAP approach, Circularity Ladder. Used streams are not considered as waste but as a source of secondary resources that are returned to either naturally occurring or technological cycles, at the required quality level. Furthermore, (technical) options and concepts to locally supply and recover/reuse resource streams are introduced and evaluated in regard of possible self-sufficiency and reuse/recovery potential based on the assumed prior knowledge (ETE 25306 Basic Technologies for Urban Environmental Management or similar). In addition, assessments and case studies are provided of situations by practitioners from the field and scientists from related academic fields, where the application of individual technologies and their appropriate combinations ensure sustainability under given local conditions regarding scale, climate and rural-urban typology. <br/>The course consists of 2 main parts: a) lectures, in which i) methodological concepts to analyse and evaluate resource flows and technological concepts are introduced, ii) possible technical concepts for closing resource cycles are discussed and iii) example cases for closed resource cycles are highlighted and b) a group assignment that challenges students to i) analyse and assess resources flows in an urban setting and ii) propose, evaluate and compare feasible measures to improve sustainability of the current practices related to energy, water and nutrient management. Furthermore, field visits to cases with (partially-)closed cycles are incorporated to show the applications of the lectures and assignment content in practice.</p>",

Do animals differ in their capacity to adapt to their environment, and if so, can animals 'learn'  to adapt? Do you need to 'acquire' adaptive capacity in early life for later functioning? If adaptive capacity is limiting, what goes wrong?  The course deals with these aspects of the functioning of animals, focusing on a selected number of themes. These themes may vary from year to year, but will mostly focus on: the vitality of young animals (since they experience many environmental changes in a vulnerable period of their life); effects of lactation on the lactating animal (since lactation and its -metabolic- consequences influences many aspects of the functioning of animals); and socially adapted animals (since animals need to interact with other animals (e.g. group housing of cattle, pigs), and also with man (dogs, cats), how do animals learn to behave).",

  "Agroecology is the scientific discipline that supports the design of sustainable agroecosystems and encompasses both ecological and social dimensions. The ultimate goal of this course is to train a new generation of agricultural ecologists that are able to integrate disciplines to inform the design and implementation of agroecological innovations at the scales of field to landscape, and as part of sustainable food systems. The course will offer the scientific knowledge bases to achieve that through six complementary modules: (1) the context of agroecology, (2) flows and cycles in agroecosystems, (3) functional biodiversity and ecosystem services, (4) agroecological practices, (5) transformation towards agroecological systems, and (6) integration, capacity building & communication. The course is built following systems thinking and theory, so that the role of human agency is seen as operating through the design of structures (abiotic, biotic, social diversity and their organisation) to achieve desirable functions (resource capture, productivity, recycling, ecological regulation, nutrition, governance).",

Special attention will be given to the life sciences and life-science technologies such as biotechnology, genomics and (bio-)nanotechnology. In our rapidly changing knowledge society, experts and non-experts tend to have different appreciations of science and technology issues. What exactly is the nature of these differences and what are the communicative  implications?  How does communication affect the perception of novel technologies, their risks and benefits?  How do people process complex information regarding particular risks and what is the role of emotions therein?  How does media coverage of risks affect the public sense of anxiety?  What is the role of trust in communication about novel technologies and how is trust built or undermined?  The course will introduce relevant perspectives from innovation theory, social psychology and sociology. Working in small groups, we analyse the communication issues around specific technological innovations of the students' choice, conduct a small piece of focus group research and develop a communication plan.

  "This course is focused on preventive management of infections and diseases. The behaviour of infectious diseases in animal populations depends on: the interaction between the individual host and the (infectious) agent, the interaction between hosts, i.e. transmission of the infectious disease agent, and the changes in the characteristics of the agent in response to control measures. All these aspects should be considered when studying the effectiveness of control measures and/or eradication programmes for zoonotic infections and infectious diseases. Focusing on reduction of disease (symptoms) in individual animals only is certainly not always the optimal strategy. Transmission can be quantified by the reproduction ratio. This can be done in experiments and in the field. Management of transmission is important in studying control measures in the veterinary field as well as in animal models meant for human medicine. Veterinary epidemiology is one of the basic sciences that contributes to management of disease, including monitoring and surveillance.",

  "<p>The aim of this course is to provide the underlying natural science to global change. After an introduction in which current questions with respect to global change are discussed, the first major theme comprises the origin and evolution of the Earth and the distribution of elements. Next, major Earth compartments are discussed, i.e. atmosphere, ocean, lithosphere, biosphere and pedosphere. The physical system (circulation) and chemical and biological controls and feedbacks to the cycling of major elements are examined for each compartment. At ecosystem level, major processes affecting C, N and P cycles are presented and evaluated with biogeochemical ecosystem models. At the global scale level, the C, N and P cycles are examined across the Earth's compartments. Emphasis is on how these cycles are linked and how regulation among the cycles takes place. Moreover, the functioning of natural cycles and the anthropogenic effects on these cycles will be assessed. A good way of quantitatively examining the interaction between cycles is the use of global biogeochemical models. Themes like deforestation, regrowth, land use and cover change, stoichiometric feedbacks, etc. will be explored with such models.</p>",

It gives a general theoretical framework that we systematically apply in the case-studies. The afternoon we devote to showing how to interpret and use different kinds of information that will be offered in the coming case studies.<br/>The first part of the course focuses on abiotic bottlenecks in restoration. We discuss N and P pollution, the interaction with hydrology (water quality &amp; -quantity) and SO4-availability and their consequences for vegetation &amp; fauna of dry and wet heaths and groundwater-dependent grasslands. With the second part we continue with biotic bottlenecks in restoration. Here the focus is on restoration of shallow lakes and the interactions between fish and algae populations and P-availability. The third part deals with a combination of social and biotic bottle necks in restoration of tropical forests, whereas the fourth part deals with (a lack of) disturbance dynamics in combination with abiotic bottlenecks in restoring floral diversity of riverine grasslands. The last part of the course focuses on applying the knowledge gained to other ecosystems and on the ethical sides of restoring ecosystems.

  "This course introduces students to interdisciplinary gender and consumption studies. Media images are in part linked to how individuals, in any given social group, view themselves and treat others and how they are viewed and treated by others. This course examines the relationship between culture, identity and commodity from a gender and diversity perspective using current concepts and theories. By taking a comparative approach, it discusses how femininities and masculinities are relationally constructed in both historical and contemporary contexts. While doing so, it pays special attention to the relationship between the marketing of products, ideals, ideas and social inequality (gender, class, race, sexuality, ethnicity and nation) and how marketing is linked to identity, social roles, and consumer behaviors. Students will collaboratively explore forms of resistance to and alternative consumer culture. Students enhance their gender and diversity sensitive media literacy by applying the concepts and theories to a case in their everyday life individually and in a small group. The analytical frameworks in this course draws on gender studies in sociology, consumption studies, cultural studies, marketing, history, anthropology, and geography.",

  "Atmospheric modelling is currently employed in a wide range of disciplines ranging from weather forecasting, air pollution studies and studies related to the coupling between soil and vegetation models and the state of the atmosphere.  This tailor-made course aims at learning the fundamental principles of atmospheric modelling,  getting acquainted with the use of state-of-the-art meteorological models and  critically analysing their results. Emphasis is placed on designing numerical experiments in relation to research questions, discussing the results by comparing them with observations or results of other models and finally on presenting the main findings.\r<br/>In the first part, we introduce the main framework of meteorological modelling by explaining the main concepts: the governing equations, principles in numerical modelling and physical/chemical representations. We revisit and integrate aspects related to dynamic meteorology, boundary-layer processes, atmospheric chemistry and land-atmosphere interactions to explain how these different components of the atmospheric system are integrated in the models. In a second part, the student will have two different modelling options. The first one suits students with an interest in learning the feedbacks among atmospheric processes characterized by different biochemical and physical nature: from purely atmospheric phenomena like investigating the optimal conditions for cloud formation to multidisciplinary subjects like atmospheric chemistry diurnal variability or the soil-vegetation-carbon dioxide-atmosphere interactions. By selecting the second option, the student will learn how to use a weather forecast model by reproducing and analysing a real meteorological situation. The subsequent sensitivity analysis of processes and key variables will enable the student to extend the analysis of the main mechanisms that have determined this meteorological situation. In both options, the student will have certain freedom in designing his/her own path of research according to his/her academic interests.",

  "Conflicts and disasters are shock events characterised by high levels of disruption and insecurity. Yet, crises are not simply about chaos and breakdown, but involve order and ordering at different levels. They present both continuities and discontinuities. This course looks at how crises are both socially produced and produce social outcomes. Students learn to problematize, conceptualise and analyse conflicts and disasters in relation to societal change and re-ordering. We problematize the connection between crisis and development. Where violent conflict and disaster are often taken as a sign of the break-down of development or as 'development in reverse', we suggest that crises are the product of processes of transformation inherently marked by inequality, which may be deepened by uneven or lop-sided development. Crisis events then become sites at which different claims about what development is, are expressed.<br/>We discuss the following issues:<br/>- crises are often associated with intense change (“extreme make over”). We explore the production and impact of change, as well as the normality in and normalisation of disaster and conflict. For this, we bring in the notion of securitisation.<br/>- we look at how people cope with the extreme conditions of insecurity and uncertainty, drawing on notions from the anthropology of conflict, such as “warscape” and “social navigation”.<br/>- in crisis situations, specific repertoires of intervention and governance come into play. Which are these, how are they justified, and how do they shape processes of in- and exclusion? We discuss the concepts of “hybrid governance” and “rebel governance”.<br/>- the course discusses methodological approaches to understand crisis and crisis interventions as social processes. The notion of “aidnography” is introduced for the ethnographic study of aid organisations.<br/>Note: This course is obligatory for MID students intending to do an MSc thesis in the domain of Disaster Studies (which covers natural hazards and disasters, violent conflict, forced displacement, and crisis response). The course is open to other students, but it is recommended they contact the course coordinator previous to enrolling, to check on prior knowledge.",

In community ecology, the focus lies on biotic interactions (competition, trophic interactions, bottom-up and top-down control and the stability of food webs). Ecosystem ecology mainly deals with interactions between organisms and the abiotic environment. Here, we focus on nutrient cycling, succession, feedbacks between vegetations and climate change and the global carbon cycle. At the landscape level, the focus lies on the structure and dynamics of natural and cultural landscapes, fragmentation, spatial relationships between different elements within the landscape and meta'-population theory. The last lecture will feature the Netherlands as an illustration of the threats biodiversity is facing, the underlying ecological processes at different spatial scales and national policy related to the conservation efforts to halt biodiversity loss.</p>",

The course is designed for students with no or little prior-knowledge of chemistry, physics and biology, still keeping it interested for those students who do have prior knowledge in these fields. \r<br/>The course will start with a case study on an existing food product, studying all elements of the food label (ingredients, nutritional value, rules and regulations, etc.) and finding out the production process of this product. The outcome of this case study will be presented to the other students in order to cover a number of production processes. To obtain a good understanding of these production processes, theories on chemical, microbial, physical and process engineering aspects will be explained in the lectures. Exercises will be worked out to illustrate the theory. Processes that will be discussed are beer brewing, production of chocolate, dairy production, sugar refinery, production of ingredients, etc. Furthermore, the course deals with the quality of foods as a function of the treatments and conditions e.g. during shipment, pasteurization/sterilization and storage.",

Onderdeel hiervan is een workshop over de manier waarop je observerend leren kunt inzetten in het taalonderwijs.\nVervolgens kijken we naar het belang van taal in teksten en toetsen van andere vakken, en naar de toetsing van lezen en schrijven, met name de inzet van formatieve toetsing en de voor- en nadelen van verschillende manieren waarop schrijfproducten beoordeeld kunnen worden (o.a. holistisch vs. analytisch).\nTot slot kijken we hoe we kunnen komen tot evidence-based adviezen voor de taalonderwijspraktijk.

  "'Food Security' means that all people, at all times, have physical and economic access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food to meet their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life. Especially in developing countries, many people are food insecure. Both undernutrition and overnutrition (obesity) are addressed. This interdisciplinary course focuses on what it means to be 'food insecure' and examines causes and solutions for this problem. The scope is from global to national, household and individual level. It aims at linking disciplines related to availability (production), sustainability/stability (in production and prices), access (distribution, entitlements) and quality (safety, nutritional composition, acceptability). Approaches come from the disciplines Economics, Nutrition, Social Sciences, Food Science, Plant Production, Plant Breeding, Animal Production, Disaster studies. The roles of multinational and national public policy and business and retail are investigated. The students play the Africulture game to experience the difficulty to achieve food security in Africa. The second halve of the course is an intensive practical, devoted to hands-on project development, considering the complexity of food insecurity at district and household level. The students analyse a situation of regional food insecurity, and use a logical framework for designing a (better) project. The course has a tight schedule and the students get a high degree of exposure. Attendance is demanded. A reader can be obtained at week 3 of the course. Students also have to prepare a debate on contested issues related to food security.",

  "This course deals with biological inorganic chemistry, discussing the presence and role of naturally and non-naturally occurring inorganic elements in biological systems. Focus is on d-block elements in various oxidation states and the molecular structure of corresponding coordination complexes considering variations in ligands and geometries. An introduction to f-block elements (lanthanide) complexes will also be given. The electron configuration and spectroscopic properties of metal complexes are evaluated with Crystal Field and Ligand Field theory. Various Magnetic Resonance (MR) spectroscopy techniques will be introduced (ESR, NMR and MRI) to evaluate the dynamics, structural properties and function of metal complexes. Homo- and heteronuclear NMR techniques will be taught with focus on nuclear spin-spin as well as electron spin-nuclear spin interactions. Homo and hetero 2D NMR techniques will be introduced, like COSY, NOESY, HSQC and HMBC. Special attention is paid to metal-ligand interactions in proteins and the structural and functional aspects thereof. The use of MR techniques to study biological systems will be explored including the application of paramagnetic metal complexes in such studies. The field of medicinal inorganic chemistry is addressed evaluating the metabolic transformation of metal-complexes in biological systems, with focus on metal-protein and metal-nucleic acids interaction. During laboratory classes diamagnetic and paramagnetic metal coordination complexes will be synthesized and analysed, linking MO theory to the (optical and magnetic) physical properties of metal compounds. It further provides training in the use of magnetic resonance and optical spectroscopic equipment, the interpretation of spectra resulting in the deduction of molecular structure and geometry.",

  "<p>Note: This course can not be combined in an individual programme with SGL-23312 Landscape Geography.<br/></p><p>During the field trips we will visit 6 distinct (semi-) natural landscape types in the Netherlands and pay special attention to the relationships between the abiotic landscape components (geomorphology, soil type, hydrology, hydrochemistry) and the biotic components (vegetation, animals) at different spatial and temporal scales.  Depending on landscape type, attention will also be paid to human (management, disturbance) influences. Landscapes to be visited are: <br/>- the dune landscape in Meijendel;<br/>- the sand landscape in Drenthse Aa;<br/>- the (deteriorated) peat landscape in Haaksbergerveen (bogs) and Westbroek (fens);<br/>- the chalk/loess landscape in Gerendal and neighborhood;<br/>- the typically Dutch polder landscape at the Eempolder near Amersfoort. <br/>Most of the excursion sites were selected for their relatively intact abiotic gradients (dry – wet, acidic – calcareous etc) with well-developed associated vegetation types. Relatively undisturbed landscapes are a prerequisite to show the relationships between environment and vegetation and to provide a good reference: in order to recognize a disturbed vegetation or ecosystem you need to know what an intact vegetation or ecosystem looks like. In the field the importance of different landscape processes for species composition of the vegetation will be discussed and vegetation composition will be shown to elucidate landscape processes. The focus during the excursions will be on indicative plant species and plant communities, supported by simple measurements on abiotic conditions. The recognition of plant communities and plant species is not a goal in itself but plant communities and species are used as a tool, i.e. as bio-indicators, to recognize the dominant abiotic processes in the landscape and their influence on the diversity of plant and animal species.</p>",

  "<p>This course deals with the processes that coordinate the development of a single cell into a complex multi-cellular organism.  In general all cells of an organism originate from a single cell and they share the same set of genes. However, they show differential gene expression and therefore cells can have different functions within an organism. The emphasis in this course is on the molecular mechanisms by which differentiation is induced at the right place and time during development (=pattern formation) and on stem cells. Stem cells have the ability to develop into (sever)all cell types (pluripotency). During the course the similarities and differences of plant and animal stem cells are explained.  Mechanisms that control pattern formation in plants as well as in animals are for example:<br/>- the formation of gradients of morphogens that are subsequently translated into distinct regions (tissues) with sharp borders;<br/>- cell communication leading to the induction of a new cell type at the interface;<br/>- noise that by lateral inhibition is translated into a pattern.<br/>The underlying molecular mechanism of such developmental concepts will be explained during the course. For example: how does a gradient of a morphogen turn on key regulators in distinctive regions which subsequently affect the expression of target genes and how can small random differences between cells lead to a typical pattern formation by cell-cell communication.</p>",

  "<p>The Food Flavour Design course is a pioneering MSc course where co-ordination and lecturers will be a combined effort between Industry and University. Unilever, Symrise and Wageningen University will be working together with the aim of bringing its content to the highest level. Flavour (aroma &amp; taste) is an important parameter in the perceived quality of a food product. At the point of consumption, it becomes a key differentiation factor that drives consumers acceptance. In the Food Flavour Design course, a holistic approach is considered through two main perspectives: 1) flavours in food (e.g., generation,  application, stability, delivery systems and labelling) , and 2) flavours perception  during food consumption (e.g., flavours receptors, physiological influences, oral processing and product architecture). The course supplies an understanding of flavour at the molecular level and its interaction with the food matrix. A compelling explanation will be provided on how flavour is generated during processing through the Maillard reaction and preserved during storage by means of minimising lipid oxidation. Both flavour chemistry insights and flavourist style approaches will be considered in designing food flavour strategies to be validated through experimentation, like generating your own meat flavour, preventing off-flavour generation by natural routes, and matching the cola flavour in a beverage. One of the many highlights of the course is the area on food/flavour cross modal interactions and flavour release in the mouth. Addressing one of the hottest topics in flavour today, such as why low-calorie foods do not taste as good as their full-calorie counterparts, and how product architecture can play an important role in overcoming this.</p><p><br/></p>",

Public Health and Applied Communication are directly connected with, depending on, and influencing the organization and development of society as such. This course will train students to interpret contemporary problems in a historical perspective. We start from long term social transitions: the economic transition (how society changed from an agrarian into a (post)-industrial society), the demographic transition (how the mortality and fertility rates dropped strongly and were accompanied by changing population and family structures); the political transition (from oligarchy to the nation-state and upcoming democracy and citizenship), the social transition (from an ascription society to an achievement society, the new problem of social inequality - including gender, class and ethnic inequality -, and the processes of individualization), the cultural transition (the role of the Enlightenment and of Romanticism, the process of secularisation and the changing role of church and religion), and the spatial transition (from local to global and back). Students will read a textbook on the history of the last two hundred and fifty years. In the tutorials these texts will be discussed in order to establish their relevance for our times.

  "<p>Digestion of food is a complex process that is essential for our life. The breakdown of food is done via a large number of complex mechanical, enzymatic and chemical processes, and is extensively controlled. This is an advanced, inter-specialization course in which the latest insights on food digestion, absorption and its regulation in the small intestine are discussed, and how disturbances in these processes may contribute to disease. To be able to modulate and optimize the digestion of foods, it is important to have insight into the various extrinsic (food-related) and intrinsic (host-related) factors that influence food digestion and nutrient absorption. For example, the macronutrients starch, proteins and lipids can form unique microstructures, which affects the rate and the extent of their digestion. Also, specific food components can modulate digestion by altering the activity of specific digestive enzymes. The course is divided into two main parts. The first part addresses the nutritional physiology of the small intestine, with an emphasis on the sensing and regulation of nutrient digestion and absorption at the molecular level. The second part focuses on the relation between food structure and digestion.<br/></p><p>Topics that will be covered include:<br/>- anatomy and histology of the small intestine;<br/>- digestion and absorption of nutrients and bioactives;<br/>- regulation of digestion and absorption;<br/>- comparative physiology of the small intestine;<br/>- pathophysiology of the small intestine;<br/>- factors affecting nutrient digestion and bioavailability;<br/>- technological strategies to modulate nutrient digestion kinetics;<br/>- bioavailability of minerals, vitamins and phytochemicals;<br/>- microencapsulation;<br/>- in vivo and in vitro models to study digestion in the small intestine;<br/>- biomarkers of bioavailability and how to measure them;<br/>- models of bioavailability and enzymatic digestion.</p>",

  "<p></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">Successful forest and nature management is increasingly based on collaboration between governments, nature conservation agencies and citizens. Experiences in the field have shown that management decisions cannot be designed or implemented without taking the relationship with broader society into consideration. Citizens expect to be involved in these decisions, and policies that do not match the views of influential social groups can cause social conflicts. Meanwhile, budgets for nature conservation are decreasing and governments in the Netherlands and many other European countries increasingly expect civil society and citizens to contribute to halting biodiversity loss. Nature conservation agencies increasingly look for new actors to contribute to conservation aims, including organised citizens. This course explores the theoretical and empirical questions of this interaction of citizens (individual and/or organised) with their natural environment. What are the benefits of nature for citizens and society at large? How do citizens contribute to nature conservation? And why do protest emerge against conservation and restoration efforts? </span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">The course will introduce theoretical concepts such as public engagement and public support, self-governance, nature experience, images of nature, sense of place and wildlife values. Key to the course is the acknowledgement of diversity in views and opinions within society and between citizens and conservationists. As nature conservation critically depends on political and societal support, conservationists need to be able to understand this diversity and discuss the consequences of this diversity for success and failure in nature conservation practices. The course will explicitly stimulate such discussions, both between students as well as between students and teachers.</span></p><p></p>",

  "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">In our daily life, we often can observe and experience phenomena and systems that are complex, such as for example social networks (among humans but also chimpanzees), traffic jams, climate changes, flying flocks of birds, or the pleasure arising while eating good food. Although these phenomena and systems belong to different disciplines and scales, they all share similar features that are essential to understanding their origin and evolution. One common feature is that on a smaller scale one can observe many components with mutual interactions and feedback couplings. Another common feature is that on larger scales one can use one same set of basic concepts (the unifying concepts in the title of this course) for describing structural morphologies of vastly different systems such as coral reefs, broccoli, artery networks in mammals, the structure of an electric circuitry in a city, or the structural arrangement of protein molecules in a dessert. Moreover, one can also use these unifying concepts to describe how properties at different scales are related. </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">In this course we introduce the above mentioned unifying concepts, such as scales, networks, universality, self-similarity, and self-organization. Besides these concepts, we introduce basic mathematical methods and tools to analyze a complex system in terms of these concepts, e.g. scaling, fractal analysis and data network analysis. This also involves using computer based graphics analysis and computer software modules. One basic reason for commonalities among small as well as large scales will be briefly addressed as well (energy minimisation). The course is a multidisciplinary course with inputs from elementary physics, chemistry, mathematics and computer usage. The course has many examples and many exercises in applications, ranging from social sciences, agri-food sciences, nutrition sciences, environmental sciences, animal sciences, plant sciences and economic sciences. </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">The course starts with addressing the complexity and underlying simplicity and unity of life, including growth, aging and mortality. It then addresses a science of cities, and discusses the far reaching consequences of the observed underlying principles. Hereto we discuss mobility and the pace of life, social connectivity, diversity, and metabolism and growth on a city scale. After this an analogy will be presented for a science of companies (including company mortality and implications of open ended growth). It will be discussed where the analogy between cities and companies stops and why companies die but cities do not. These topics build up towards the final part of the course in which a perspective on sustainability is presented that is based on the underlying unifying principles treated thus far and how these are and will be governing the current developments in this area. In the end we also briefly address some aspects of Big Data in the perspective of the course. </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">The course provides an opportunity to learn about unifying concepts and their practical use to help us understand similarities om organisation, structure and dynamics among vastly different complex systems with relevance to the broader area of life sciences (agri-food, social, animal, plant, environmental and economic sciences). </span></p><p><br/></p>",

  "The \"come back\" of religion is subject to much public debate. While church membership and attendance in mainstream Christianity declines in Northern Europe, the evangelical movement thrives. With the arrival of migrant churches, Islamic groups and New Age, the religious field is diversified. All over the world, religious revival movements manifest themselves as major public players, often by making prolific use of the latest media technologies. Scholars agree that secularization theory, which assumed that modernization entails the decline of (the public significance) of religion, has lost its explanatory power. How to develop adequate theories and methods to grasp the place and role of religion in the 21st century is the burning question in the sociology of religion. In the first part, this class introduces foundational thinkers and key concepts, including the rise and critique of secularization theory and post-secular concepts. Exploring the various concrete manifestations of religion in our time (including New Age and the search for spirituality, the rise of transnational Pentecostal and Islamic movements, and the resilience of orthodox forms of Christianity), the second part presents new foci in the contemporary study of religion that help us understand how religions transform via a constant exchange with wider society.",

  "<p>Starting point for this course is the idea that processes of change presume a thorough insight into people's everyday communication strategies. The course is particularly concerned with the analysis of real-life conversations (Discursive Psychology/Conversation Analysis) and applying these insights to topical communication practices, varying from public debates on healthy food and climate change to online discussions on new (bio)technologies. The focus will be on the different ways in which people influence each other as part of their daily routine as well as on how practitioners can learn from these methods. We look at how credibility is constructed in negotiations and debates, for example by adopting particular identities ('layman' vs. 'expert') or resisting the ascription of (self-)interests. We study how people manage knowledge rights and responsibilities in talk: what makes people being treated as more or less knowledgeable? Expertise may be a contested matter, such as in public debates on vaccination or climate change. We look at when and how scientific knowledge is used to support or challenge an argument, and to what purposes experiential knowledge is put forward. We not only analyse the causes of apparent misunderstandings but also discuss what can be done to facilitate these conversations. Students will be introduced into the world of institutional interaction: online counseling, medical interaction and public engagement meetings between pill designers and patients. We learn how the preferences or presuppositions incorporated in questions may restrict - or broaden - recipients’ scope for saying things in and on their own terms. Finally, we will focus on different ways of using interaction-analytic research in practice. With the so-called Discursive Action Method (DAM) and the Conversation-Analytic Role play Method (CARM) participants can be turned into critical analysts of their own discourse, and be stimulated to design their own change process.</p>",

A lot of attention is given to biological water quality control though photo- and heterotrophic processes in natural waters or in purpose-build reactors. The focus is on how farm system components and management options determine farming success and sustainability. During the course, the students build and operate recirculating aquaculture production systems, relying on different types of bioreactors. The contribution of each bioreactor to the nutrient balance in systems is analysed, and compared with other bioreactors. This knowledge is applied in the design of a fish farm, including effluent control and management, and dealing with both intensive and extensive types of farming.",

  "<p>Note: For information about ACT registration deadlines and other details for enrolling to the ACT course see: https://actregistration.wur.nl/<br/>The Academic Consultancy Training course is a 9 ECTS course which starts each period (except period 4) of the year. Period 3 and 4 is a combined period (the two weeks of the re-exams between period 3 and 4 are not scheduled for ACT). ACT is an eight week course scheduled in the mornings of weeks 1-3 and week 8 (the last week), and full time during weeks 4-7.  <br/>In the ACT course, teams of 5 to 7 students are assigned to execute a transdisciplinary-oriented academic consultancy project for an external commissioner (for example governmental, private and civil society organizations). These teams are composed on the basis of required disciplinary mix for the execution of the project and the preferences expressed by students. Through an application letter students indicate what their disciplinary knowledge will add to the execution of the project. Each team has an assigned process coach and a content coach/academic advisor relevant to the project.<br/>The multidisciplinary and preferably multicultural team will carry out a design type project for  their commissioner. This might be the design of new technologies, policy papers, business strategies, regional development arrangements, communication plans or draft research plans for integrated research programmes. Crucial is that teams bring together academic insights and practical knowledge, reach a synthesis of the compiled information in consultation with the commissioner, and translate this into an advice on future actions for their commissioner. <br/>The ACT course is scheduled in such a way that students can combine the course with MOS modules. Note that there are different versions of ACT like Entrepreneurial ACT (E-ACT) and Sustainability Transitions ACT (S-ACT). Those versions are offered only in some of the periods throughout the year. More information about those different versions of ACT and the periods in which they are offered, as well as other information about registration to the ACT course and practicalities can be found on the ACT course website. That is: <a href=\"https://actregistration.wur.nl/\">https://actregistration.wur.nl/</a> . Via this ACT course website students have to pre-register no later than roughly one period in advance and for period 1 this implies in May the preceding study year. Exact closing dates for registration can be found on the homepage of the ACT course website. This pre-registration and the keywords students enter there describing their expertise, are used to search for meaningful ACT projects. Please note that it  is not possible to register for this course via SSC. After students have applied and been assigned to a team the course coordinator will take care of the registration of the participants at SSC, this is generally done in week 1 of a period.</p>",

  "<p>The course provides an introduction on how ecological factors determine the productivity of a crop and on how models can be used to integrate and quantify the influence of the environment on crop production. The course is structured around three levels of crop production (potential, water- and nutrient limited and actual) and deals with both a-biotic and biotic production constraints. The methodological part of the course consists of an introduction to the basic principles of modelling. Modelling as a tool for the integration of key processes in production ecology is exemplified with case studies on soil organic matter dynamics and crop-weed interaction. Next to the focus on crop production, sustainability aspects of farming systems are treated. For this, the environmental impact of crop production in conventional and biological farming systems is compared and the importance of crop rotation for sustainability is elucidated. Throughout the course, theoretical concepts and methodological issues are linked and applied in exercises, practicals and case studies. In the final week an organic farm will be visited.</p>",

Farmers worldwide play a central role in SLM: they take the final decision about what to do with their land. In this course the red thread is the influence of policies on why farmers take decisions in favour or not of SLM. Adequate and effectively implemented policies might create an enabling environment for triggering investments in SLM; but inadequate policies or the lack of clear rules, regulations and collaborative governance often result in the pursuit of short-term (economic) benefits accompanied by increased land degradation. How policies and policy-making at different levels influence SLM and the decisions taken by different stakeholders is in this course analysed in three diverse cases: 1) The effect of EU policies on agriculture and the environment; 2) Multilevel governance of agrochemicals; 3) Land Degradation Neutrality and the role of the UNCCD. </span><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">The final purpose of this course is that students – in their future working field – are more aware of the influence of policy-making on land management, and that they are better prepared to assess the scope and possibilities of policies.

These human activities have led to global warming, urban heat islands, urban wind nuisance, deteriorated human thermal comfort and contribute to the depletion of fossil fuel resources. In turn, one may limit these effects by careful design of renewable energy interventions and a climate responsive design of urban morphologies. In this course, students get acquainted with the basic and advanced methods to reverse these adverse climate effects through the planning and design of both urban and rural landscapes. First, students acquire the scientific physical basis of energy systems and water cycles as drivers behind the urban climate. Second, the renewable energy sources and potential technologies are identified. Third, students learn to analyse and evaluate energy and urban climate systems. The results of the analyses form the basis for climate- responsive and energy-conscious planning and design interventions on various scale levels.</p>",

Subsequently, the lectures are divided into a technofunctional and a biofunctional part. <br/>Technofunctionality<br/>- The physical systems which are relevant to food products (various kinds of emulsions, gels, and foams) are described. The various forces/concepts underlying the stability of these systems are discussed in much detail. <br/>- The structure-function relationships of the various classes of food ingredients (polysaccharides, proteins, and lipids/surfactants) are discussed in detail. Much emphasis is put on molecular diversity, i.e. rather subtle structural differences can lead to substantially different properties of particular compounds. For instance, when the label of a product reads pectin, it is often not realized that there are many different kinds of pectin (low-methoxyl, high-methoxyl with a random distribution, high-methoxyl with a blockwise distribution, amidated pectin, etc.) with completely different application targets.<br/>- A number of “challenging” products are discussed in detail. Here, the stability of systems and ingredient choice merge, and the fact that various ingredients can interact with each other becomes much more apparent. This part intends to make you aware of the fact that the food matrix is very complex, and that it is often not possible to replace one compound with another one without affecting the stability of the food system.<br/>Biofunctionality<br/>This part of the course is focussed on novel (fashionable) developments in the food industry, which are aimed at improving the intrinsic health of consumers.

  "Living renewable resources in marine, coastal and large freshwater ecosystems provide food, income and employment in many parts of the world and have many non-consumptive use values. Impacts on these resources and ecosystems occur through fishing for food and income. But there are also direct and indirect impacts as tourism, sport fishing, wind energy parks, conservation measures such as Marine Protected Areas and pollution. Effective management of the use of marine ecosystems requires a social–ecological systems approach to analyse the problems arising from the interactions between the ecosystem and the decisions of resource users and managers. In this course management is treated as a continuous decision-making process. Based on realistic problem formulations by those involved in management ecologically sound, economically feasible and socially acceptable objectives are formulated. A strong focus of the course is on the collection and presentation of adequate information on fisheries, fish stocks, ecosystems and their biophysical and economic drivers. This requires both good science as well as good communication to help stakeholders to make sense of the available information. A final part of the management cycle is the analysis and evaluation of the effectiveness of management measures. You will obtain basic and advanced insights into fisheries, marine ecological and environmental-economic concepts and tools of analysis and apply these on specific management problems. You will practice these ecological and economic concepts and tools to resource use problems aided by a social-ecological systems framework, and apply them in case studies about distinct resource use problems in different ecosystems: oceans, tropical and temperate coastal ecosystems and large lakes. In these case studies you will analyse the problems, review information and design management advice considering the perspectives of users and other stakeholders with different objectives related to issues around exploitation and (biodiversity) conservation of marine living resources and their ecosystems.",

  "<p>The course consists of the Bachelor Assessment (1 credit) and the thesis report (11 credits) . Students are only allowed to start with their thesis writing after the successful completion of the Assessment part.<br/>a) The assessment assists students in developing a clear view on their personality, characteristics and potential. Using the outcomes of an aptitude test students start thinking about their career in an early stage of the academic program. This will strengthen their ability to make proper choices in study programs and focus from year 3 on. They will visit an alumnus working in their field of interest for a 'reality check'. Students discuss, based on acquired insights, a well explained study plan with the study advisor.<br/>b) The BSc thesis<br/>The BSc thesis can be written under supervision of the staff of the chair groups: BEC, INF, MCB, MST, ORL or FQD. The student has to study (by means of a literature review or empirical/explorative research) a subject within the field of the major and prove to have sufficient knowledge to critically analyse and summarize the given subject. He/she must also be able to clearly communicate the findings in writing and by oral presentation. The subject will be determined in consultation with the thesis supervisor. The student has to define the research problem and formulate research questions in a proper way, deal with the logistics of carrying out such an individual research project, plan and schedule the different activities in a decent way, and present the results in writing in a clearly organized report.</p>",

The problem-based learning approach is based on the idea that it is an effective and durable way to develop into a professional. Lectures provide the needed theory, and assignments are offered to obtain hands on experience with quantitative data analyses. During these assignments you will use advanced methodologies and software (for example excel, R, GIS programs, and conservation planning programs) to address problems spanning a wide range of wildlife conservation issues such as threats to species, genetic analysis, population viability analysis, the role of protected areas, socio-economic aspects, and ecosystem/landscape management and planning. Furthermore, students will work in groups on case studies that allow them to independently address species conservation issues using advanced methodologies learned earlier during the course.</p>",

  "Biochemical and Molecular (Cell) Biology research has resulted into new insights in the strategies cells use to regulate their processes. These molecular concepts will be discussed in this course. This includes the biochemistry of regulatory strategies of cellular processes, the biochemistry of signal-transducing pathways and the human sensory systems. The hormonal and enzymatic regulation of pathways controlling metabolism and cell identity will be discussed as examples of regulation at the organismal level. The biochemical part of this course will be finished by studying actual topics related to regulatory strategies in a small group. At the end of the course, the results of these studies will be presented in a lecture.\r<br/>Genome wide sequence analysis has resulted in the identification of all the genes of several organisms. This can be seen as the climax of research driven by a reductionisms approach. With all the building blocks (ao proteins) at hand, the most important challenge in biology is a more synthetic approach to try to understand the connections between the building blocks. This part of the lectures will be centred on the theme Cancer. Tumour cells are in general formed when genes controlling the cell cycle, DNA repair, apoptosis, nuclear organisation or cell mobility are mutated (cancer is a DNA disease). Therefore studies on mechanisms underlying cancer formation have provided major insight in how these processes are controlled.\r<br/>It is essential to study the behaviour and interaction of molecules in a living cell which has a very different context (molecular crowding) from the diluted solutions, which have been mostly used for these studies. An introduction will be given in several innovative light microscopic techniques (FRAP, FRET) that are very suitable to study this. \r<br/>With the help of a digital case a more mathematical background of the mechanisms that drive the cell cycle (involving stable steady states, transitions, feedback loops, thresholds, oscillations) will be explained.",

See for more information: https://tcs.sites.uu.nl/\nThe lectures of this course are in English. If there is only 1 seminar group, the seminars and discussions will also be entirely in English. When there are two seminar groups, there is one seminar group in English. For Dutch students, assessment can take place in either English or Dutch. The assessment for students who major in History (English) is in English.\nFrom a Western European perspective, the rise of global enterprise is a success story that begins with the establishment of the Dutch and English East India Companies around 1600. These giants of early capitalism allegedly paved the way for the creation of modern corporations. These corporations, in turn, changed the face of the world economy as they built multinational concerns with very large production facilities and global trade networks. But is this really a success story? In this course we will explore the history of Dutch multinationals from the VOC to Shell to answer this question. We will analyse the economic contribution of these big corporations in comparison to the much larger number of small and medium-sized enterprises, often owned by families instead of anonymous shareholders. We will also look for the damage the multinational corporations may have done to the world, through their careless handling of natural resources, their exploitation of workers, or their cornering of markets driving up prices to the disadvantage of global consumers. These are well-known criticisms, of course, but are they valid?\nThe course consists of three parts. In the first four weeks, students will study the historical literature about the development of corporate enterprise between 1600 and 2000. In weeks 5 through 8 students use primary and secondary sources to write a 4,000 words paper that explores the positive or negative impact of a particular Dutch business (e.g. a colonial company, an international merchant house, or a multinational corporation) on society. Students are free to choose sides, focusing for instance on technological progress, the growth of trade, and increased employment, or rather on human exploitation, the depletion of natural resources, or the abuse of market power.",

For the physical part the focus is on phenomena that play a role in the production of products like ice cream, chocolate and bakery products. Examples of these phenomena include absorption, water migration, phase transition, fat and ice crystallization, rheology of dispersions and flavour release. These phenomena have an effect on the shelf-life of products and textural changes, which are important both in industry and restaurant. These phenomena are also related to techniques that are used in 'modern restaurants'. Analytical techniques to quantify properties of ingredients and products will also be treated. For the chemical part, the focus is on flavour aspects (mainly the taste modalities bitter, sweet, umami, and astringent) and the effect of specific ingredients on structural changes (i.e. in ice-making and baking). The analytical methods in the practical will focus on describing the quality and sensory aspects of products, mainly the volatiles and non-volatiles in wine. A digital wine module is used to prepare the students for flavour analysis of wine. To combine the different aspects, a workshop on flavour pairing will be given, in which we will present a model to classify foods based on both chemical aspects (sweet, bitter, etc) and physical aspects (structure of food).",

  "Biorefinery concerns the technology for sustainable processing of biomass from plants, organisms and biomass available in waste streams into a spectrum of marketable products and energy. Biorefinery is a key to the biobased economy and it is expected that the state of art methods for biorefinery will significantly progress in the next decades. To progress current technology, methods for biorefinery design must be developed. This course concerns approaches how to design biorefineries and to how to develop new conversion, extraction and separation concepts. <br/>Efficiency of biorefinery increases by the production of a spectrum of products from the available biomass. Therefore, the course considers design methods of biorefinery processing systems for the usage of all components from biomass. The performance of the used technology is also affected by constraints which result from operational and investment costs and the scale of operation. Criteria to evaluate the biorefinery system with respect to these criteria are discussed and used to reconsider a biorefinery system. <br/><br/>Specific subjects in the course are: <br/>- overview of the challenges to overcome in designing a biorefinery;<br/>- overview of feedstock and biobased products; <br/>- conversion of feedstocks to products and the role of physical treatments and catalysis;<br/>- functional analysis for separation of resources and generation of solutions; <br/>- development of mass and energy balances for unit operations;<br/>- design of biorefinery process units and full system for a range of products; <br/>- recovery of resources in the biorefinery system; <br/>- the evaluation of the system with respect to economic criteria; <br/>- criteria for successful implementation (operational and investment costs).",

  "De module „Deutschland nach der Einheit (1990): Wende- und Krisenzeiten“ grijpt terug op de beide modules „Van eenwording tot eenwording: Duitsland in de twintigste eeuw in geschiedeniscultuur en cultuurbemiddeling” (Groningen) en „Kulturkunde: Kunst und Kritik“ (Amsterdam) en zet deze ook voort. Temporair gezien richt het college zijn blik op het jongste Duitse verleden en het nu. Sinds de Duitse Eenwording in 1990 heeft zich een aantal “Wenden” (die Wende, Energiewende, digitale Wende..) en crises (Finanzkrise, Eurokrise, Flüchtlingskrise…) voltrokken. Deze omwentelingen en crises vormen in het college het thematische kader voor de verwerving van theoretische en methodische uitgangspunten, die niet alleen naar de historische contexten verwijzen maar ook naar problemen die hieraan ten grondslag liggen.\nDe cultuurwetenschappelijke beschrijving en cultuurdidactische bemiddeling van de tegenwoordige tijd is gebonden aan bijzondere voorwaarden: want wat vormt het huidige Duitsland? Zijn het de gebeurtenissen die in Duitsland plaatsvinden, waarover men in de media leest en hoort? Zijn het de mensen, die in Duitsland leven en die op deze gebeurtenissen respectievelijk op hun mediarepresentatie reageren? Is het de geschiedenis van dit land, die deze reacties meer of minder evident stuurt? Is het de taal of zijn het de verschillende kunsten, dus artefacten, waarin gebeurtenissen, reacties, geschiedenis hun uitdrukking vinden? De lijst laat zich moeiteloos uitbreiden. Reeds de paar hier gestelde vragen tonen dat de beschrijving en de verklaring daarvan, wat een land als Duitsland lijkt te vormen, een complexe opgave is. Voor de tegenwoordige tijd bestaat doorgaans nog geen canon die voor persoonlijke indrukken als oriëntatie kan dienen. In het naspeuren van de Zeitgeist ligt het risico modeverschijnselen achterna te lopen, waaraan niemand zich enige tijd later nog herinnert. Het probleem wordt verergerd door het feit dat veel cultuurwetenschappers en sociologen vandaag de dag denken dat de tegenwoordige tijd „onleesbaar“ is (Mark Lilla).\nPrecies dit dilemma, de moeilijkheid om een cultuur „leesbaar“ te maken, staat centraal. Het overkoepelende doel is het bevorderen van de competenties, die de studenten als toekomstige leraren in de praktijk nodig hebben: de didactische reductie, het exemplarische aanschouwelijk maken en de keuze voor onderwerpsgerichte methodiek. Concreet verwerven de studenten de vaardigheid om hun eigen perspectief op Duitsland te bepalen en didactisch te modelleren. Geleid door cultuurwetenschappelijk relevante modellen, theorieën en analysetechnieken leren zij hun beeld van Duitsland door middel van passende voorbeelden te concretiseren en aan de cursusdeelnemers te verduidelijken. Tot slot worden alle perspectieven op Duitsland van de studenten verzameld en op stereotiepen getoetst. Zo kan elke student sein uitgangspositie in de context van de discussie relativeren en verbreden. Deze leerprocessen worden niet alleen ondersteund door de gebruikelijke methoden zoals presentaties en discussies maar ook door Blended Learning-tools (databases aanleggen, het schrijven van Wikis, onderlinge feedback met „Peermark“).\nInhoudelijk baseert deze poging om een beeld van het huidige Duitsland te scheppen zich op de ervaringen en observaties die de studenten tijdens het buitenlandsemester opgedaan hebben. Deze worden aan het begin van de collegereeks verzameld. De begrippen Wende en Krise fungeren dan als thematische uitgangspunten. Aan de hand van geselecteerde voorbeelden (geschikt zouden bijvoorbeeld zijn de opkomst van de AfD, cross-media-kunstenaren zoals Peter Licht of het „geval“ Böhmermann) worden de motivatie en de strategieën van tijdgenoten, die de \"Krisenkultur Deutschland\" (Dirk Baecker) thematiseren, kritisch onderzocht. In zoverre de omgang met daadwerkelijke en vermeende crises vaak in taal tot uitdrukking komt (omdat taal als een paradigma van het contemporaine, cutuurwetenschappelijke denken geldt), worden studenten gestimuleerd hun aandacht ook op taalgebruik en taalkritiek te richten. Op deze manier worden niet alleen hun analyse- en reflectievaardigheden aangescherpt, maar ook hun begrip van de nauwe samenhang tussen taal, artistieke uitdrukkingsvormen, socioculturele identiteit.",

But also behaviours by other actors may influence health outcomes. Think of the prescription of antibiotics in human and veterinary medicine, which influences public health through antimicrobial resistance. Consequently, behaviour change is an important target for interventions to address these issues. In this course you learn how to systematically develop interventions to create behaviour change. Different intervention design frameworks are introduced (e.g., intervention mapping, behaviour-centred design, behaviour change wheel) and you learn how to systematically apply these frameworks. Communication plays a role at different ecological levels of interventions, as well as in the phases of intervention development, evaluation and implementation; you learn how communicative processes shape and facilitate these different phases.</span></p>",

Tourism always involves mobility - travel, but travel does not always fall into the category of tourism. Holidays are always about recreation, but the purpose of tourism is not always recreational. Tourism is commonly understood within an economic framework, in terms of supply and demand. A complex of factors shape demand for specific tourism products. Gaining insight into demand is essential for success for suppliers of tourism products and tourism organisations, which comprise the 'tourism industry'. Yet, while it is perfectly understandable to speak of the 'tourism industry', it does not adequately or fully capture the tourism phenomenon. Thinking about tourism from a systems-based perspective, allows us to be alert to the myriad exchanges and impacts generated by tourism for those both directly and indirectly involved in its pursuit and provision. This course, therefore, introduces students to the economic, environmental and socio- cultural impacts necessary to fully comprehend tourism as a system and its place within a complex global context. This course aims to provide students with an organising framework within which to locate the other and  subsequent elements of the BSc Tourism programme. It will provide students (who may have no previous knowledge of tourism and leisure) with an introduction to the general principles and main components of tourism.  The course is international in nature, drawing on examples and practices from different countries. In addition it will provide students with an appreciation of the study of tourism as a domain within its own right.</p>",

  "A foodscape is a socio-economic arrangement of a food system, placed in the biophysical context of a landscape. This is the scale and interdisciplinary level at which sustainability can be effectively assessed and managed.  A foodscape is characterised by, inter alia, its soils, topography, climate, rivers, land use, fields, farms, crops, livestock, vegetation, habitats, residents, farmers, land owners, retailers, consumers, policies, legislation, communication and governance structures and their mutual interdependencies. Each foodscape is unique; it is a reflection of local bio-physical conditions, as well as cultural and socio-economic conditions. Some foodscapes are exemplars of sustainable food production, while others may be evolving towards or away from a sustainable future.<br/><br/>In the face of this complexity, how can science inform the transition of foodscapes towards environmental, economic and social sustainability? Solutions that make sense from a biological or geographical perspective may be wholly inappropriate within the local cultural or socio-economic context, or vice versa: social innovations may not be suitable given local biophysical constraints. Therefore, transitions towards sustainability require a comprehensive, interdisciplinary diagnosis of individual foodscapes.<br/>In this course, we will teach students principles and applications of a range of approaches to analyse foodscapes as systems through multiple lenses, with a portfolio of scientific methods. Rather than competing with each other, these methods are complementary and – together – can be used to diagnose foodscapes, show different perspectives, guide planning and decision-making for interventions and visualise transition pathways. <br/>Examples of the foodscape analysis approaches include:<br/>- fuzzy cognitive mapping (FCM), to map external and internal drivers and interactions in foodscapes;<br/>- sampling procedures for surveys and experimental design in communities and fields/landscapes;<br/>- statistical typologies and Q-methodology, for the characterisation of diversity and heterogeneity in foodscapes;<br/>- social and Ecological Network Analysis (SNA and ENA) and Signal mapping, to analyse social and ecological systems as networks;<br/>- pareto-based multi-objective optimisation with evolutionary algorithms applied to inverse modelling and farm/landscape models to explore trade-offs in decision making;<br/>- functional land management and public-private benefits framework, to match demand and supply of ecosystem services in foodscapes;<br/>- agent Based Modelling (ABM) to simulate interactions and dynamics in social-ecological systems.<br/><br/>We will use the International Network of Lighthouse Farms (Creating a global outdoor classroom and laboratory on sustainable foodscapes: https://www.wur.nl/en/Research-Results/Chair-groups/Plant-Sciences/Farming-Systems-Ecology-Group/Lighthouse-project.htm ) as our real-life case studies.

  "This module introduces students to the demand for water process innovation in an international context. In order to achieve this goal, first students are presented with the current global challenges related to water such as water scarcity, water pollution and its effects on health. State of the art technologies for the production of drinking water and treatment of wastewater are introduced in this course. Main characteristics of these technologies are presented such as influent quality requirements, energy demands, land use, chemical use among others. Based on this information, the applicability of a determined technology is discussed in two types of country environment: low- and high-income countries. Each of these country categories grapples with a different set of issues. Low-income countries prioritize meeting basic human needs for water and combating waterborne infections, while high-income countries seek ways of closing urban and industrial water cycles in order to protect their ecological integrity. Furthermore, countries may deal with the challenge of solving the water quantity and quality problems caused by rapid industrial growth and urbanization. During the course students' , capacity to recommend a suitable technological solution based on given circumstances will be tested. Students will be asked to write a scientific report by doing a critical literature review on a topic relevant to current research in Water Technology.

Maar aan het begin van de 21e eeuw heeft deze overwinningsroes inmiddels in heel Europa plaatsgemaakt voor twijfel. De democratie zou zich in een diepe crisis bevinden, gekenmerkt door de opkomst van populistische bewegingen, een versplintering van het parlement, een ‘kloof tussen burger en politiek’, en de teloorgang van traditionele politieke partijen.\n \nDeze democratische crisis is echter allerminst nieuw. In deze cursus onderzoeken we de notie van een ‘crisis van de democratie’ vanaf de vestiging van de moderne democratie in Europa in de nadagen van de Eerste Wereldoorlog tot heden. Studenten onderzoeken de aanval op de democratie van fascisme, Nazisme en communisme in het Interbellum; de systeemkritiek van sociale bewegingen in de jaren zestig en zeventig, en de opkomst van populistische partijen vanaf de jaren negentig en sluiten de cursus af met een zelfstandig onderzoek op basis van primair bronnenmateriaal naar een historische of actuele ontwikkeling, gebeurtenis, ideologie, partij of persoon die van belang is geweest in de geschiedenis van de democratie sinds 1918. Qua bronnenmateriaal kunnen studenten daartoe bijvoorbeeld gebruik maken van politieke pamfletten van sociale bewegingen, propagandamateriaal uit (verkiezings)campagnes, en debatten uit het parlement, maar ook van krantenartikelen en andere bijdragen aan het publieke debat.",

  "The course is directed at understanding specific air quality issues at the local and urban scale, the regional scale and the global scale. At all scales the focus is on the complete cycle of natural and anthropogenic air pollutants, i.e. what happens between emission, transport in the atmosphere, chemical conversions and deposition on the land/ocean surface, with explicit attention for the effects on human and environmental health, as well as the feasibility of alternatives and the efficiency of regulation and policy. The role of meteorology on air pollution mixing and transport is also explained on each scale. In other words, the complete emission-effect causality chain.\r<br/>At the local scale the focus is on traffic and industrial emissions, the role of vegetation and photochemical smog. On the regional scale the focus is on acidification and eutrophication (the nitrogen problem). On the global scale the focus is on the ozone hole, the interaction of air pollutants, atmospheric radiation and global warming.\r<br/>These air quality issues are supported by 5 practicals, explaining and quantifying chimney plumes, traffic pollution at the urban scale, aerosol effects on solar radiation, atmospheric chemistry and transport at urban and global scales.

After their seizure of power in the Interwar era, they successfully remained in in charge for years, with far-reaching consequences. They shrewdly invented modern propaganda techniques which generated widespread support, they orchestrated the violent repression of any domestic opposition, and they were responsible for violence and persecution on a massive and unprecedented scale in occupied territories in Europe and beyond.\nThis course compares the dictatorships of Hitler’s Germany, Mussolini’s Italy and Stalin’s Soviet Union. First, we delve into the question of what comparative historical research actually entails, how it can be applied and what insights it might provide. Second, we compare three dictatorships on four key aspects: the rise of the leaders; the consolidation of their power; the leaders’ relationship with ‘ordinary citizens’; and the radicalisation of their regimes.

  "Het christendom is een wereldreligie in de meest letterlijke zin van het woord. Het christendom heeft zich namelijk verspreid over alle continenten. Sterker nog, de huidige groei van het christendom is met name in Afrika, Azië en Latijns Amerika. Daar ligt, anno 2014, het centrum – en de toekomst – van de christelijke traditie. De beeldvorming van het christendom in de 21st eeuw wordt bepaald door christenen in Afrika en Latijns Amerika. Reden genoeg om eens verder te kijken dan het westen als het gaat om de wereld van het christendom. \n \nDit college schetst de ontwikkeling van het christendom van een beweging tot een mondiale religie, waarbij ruime aandacht wordt gegeven aan het christendom in de niet-Westerse wereld. In de cursus wordt aandacht geschonken aan hoe het christendom zich verspreidde en transformeerde door zowel tijd en culturen heen en welke belangrijke theologisch thema's dit heeft opgeleverd. Gekozen is voor een geografische opzet. Dit betekent concreet dat per week een continent centraal staat. In het eerste hoorcollege van de week wordt telkens gekeken naar de kerkhistorische dimensie terwijl in het tweede college de inhoudelijke thema’s en cruciale figuren centraal staan.\n \nIn de werkgroepen worden kernteksten uit de christelijke traditie gelezen. Elke werkgroep heeft een eigen thema. Voorbeelden van thema's zijn: christendom als 'verboden' religie, de kerk van het oosten, hervormingsbewegingen in het christendom, christendom, slavernij en racisme, keerpunten in de 20e eeuw.",

By presenting and discussing recently completed and on -going research projects a wide range of research methodologies will be introduced.<br/>As such this course acquaints students with the most important scientific theoretical perspectives and paradigms of place-based development and food provisioning and their social, political and academic context. In doing so the course presents a comprehensive framework for a thorough  analysis of the heterogeneous and multidimensional character of socio-spatial transformation processes. Within that framework the on-going scientific and policy debates about food provisioning and place-based development fall into place.<br/>In addition to a thorough and in-depth  elaboration of these debates, food provisioning and place based development practices will be analysed.

  "Future growth of fish supplies to meet the demands of the growing world population will have to come from aquaculture. The development strategies which the sector must follow to realize this challenge, depend on a combination of concerns over global food security, environmental sustainability, economic efficiency, international trade and technological development. Understanding the relationship between these drivers requires an understanding of the biological and technical possibilities of aquaculture as well as the globalised context within which the sector develops. This course examines this development by introducing students to different types of aquaculture production systems considering technologies, scales and species, components of the aquaculture value chain, and the environmental, social, and economic implications which interfere with the possibilities for growth of the sector. Three credits will be spent to explain biological and technical possibilities and limits of organisms or communities in man-made aquatic ecosystem managed for production. This will help to understand or even predict societal concerns, including pollution and animal welfare or food safety issues. The other 3 credits will explore consequences on the economic position in the sector and options to address these concerns considering possible frameworks of private and governmental regulations. Subsequently, we explore how these regulations, trade and business considerations drive decisions on the growth directions in the sector. In addition students will be required to develop their own species related case study through which they will explore the comparisons and interactions between farm types, cultured species and the mentioned environmental, social and economic implications.",

  "<p>This course introduces urban environmental infrastructure in the context of rapid urbanization on the one hand, and technological innovation on the other. Its main focus is on urban environmental infrastructure, i.e. the systems to provide urban households and offices with energy, drinking water, sanitation and waste (water) services.<br/>The course begins with an introduction of the different physical and organizational elements describing the existing systems to handle urban energy and water services. The development of these systems is given a historical perspective, highlighting the processes and key drivers of their development for different urban typologies (developing, transition and developed countries).<br/>A major challenge for managing urban environmental infrastructures that is addressed, is the asset management of the ageing existing urban infrastructures in the context of the crowded subsurface in which many stakeholders claim room for their cables and pipes. The transition towards multi-asset management is placed in the perspective of building new infrastructures in developing areas.<br/>A second challenge that is addressed is the development of new ways of recovering energy and nutrients from waste water streams together with the impact of decentralised energy generation on the total cycle of water services. Guest lecturers are invited to share their experiences in relation to this aspect. <br/>Exercises<br/>In this course students will carry out a group work in which the development of the infrastructure of the city of the future is explored and presented. The assignment concentrates on the development of one infrastructure (clean water, waste water or energy) in two possible surroundings (newly built city or transition from present to future situation). The 6 variations are analysed on a number of parameters in groups of 4 tot 5 students and presented in a short report and presentation at the end of the course.<br/>Excursions<br/>The course includes one to two excursions, depending on available time and locations. Potential excursion locations include infrastructure managing authorities (e.g. municipality), infrastructure operating companies (e.g. drinking water, wastewater, electricity, etc). New urban development or utility rehabilitation may be visited if available. Students will learn from the excursions how multiple urban infrastructure is designed, installed, maintained and demolished in practice.<br/></p>",

  "Computer Modelling of Biomolecules has become an indispensable tool in biomolecular science and technology, next to experiments and theory. For example, it plays a key role in the discovery of new drugs, in structure elucidation of proteins and protein complexes. Building on a basic background in physical chemistry (see assumed knowledge above), this course introduces the basic theory behind biomolecular simulation techniques such as molecular mechanics, molecular dynamics, Langevin Dynamics and Brownian Dynamics, and Monte Carlo simulations. A last part of the course deals with Quantum Chemical Modelling. While the emphasis of the course is on applications of computer simulations to biomolecules, the techniques discussed in the course apply more generally, so the course is also of interest for students that have a more general interest in computer simulations of molecules. Tutorial's with exercises are used as an aid to obtain a working understanding of the theory, and computer practicals are used to learn to work with the various simulation techniques on simple example projects.",

  "The first part provides an introduction about the wastewater characteristics important for the design of biological treatment plants. The basic principles of biological treatment are introduced, including basic microbial principles, kinetics of microbial conversions, stoichiometry and mass balances for pollutants or resources and biomass. The necessity to operate biomass retention systems is discussed and general design criteria for treatment systems are presented. This part is illustrated with municipal wastewater treatment as employed in developed countries and explains aerobic removal of organic matter, nitrogen and phosphorus removal in activated sludge processes and how to design such processes in relation to the wastewater characteristics.\r<br/>The second part of the course focuses on anaerobic treatment of wastewaters and waste slurries as a method to produce the energy carrier methane from these waste streams. Anaerobic metabolism is explained as well as toxicity aspects, the most commonly applied reactor types and design criteria for these.\r<br/>The third part deals with removal and recovery of sulfur from wastewaters and liquids generated during treatment of waste gases. The (micro)biological sulfur cycle will be explained, including oxidation and reduction processes and substrates and products involved in these processes. Reactor concepts applying these microbial processes are introduced and design criteria for such reactors are explained. \r<br/>Organic matter in wastewaters represents a potential source of energy. Lecture part 4 will demonstrate possibilities to convert organic matter in electricity, methane (see above) or hydrogen gas by microbial based processes. The feasibility to perform such conversion processes is explored using thermodynamic principles and calculations. This is further illustrated with a number of innovative technologies including microbial fuel cells.\r<br/>Metals in wastewaters often are (toxic) pollutants and sometimes scarce resources at the same time. The fifth lecture part deals with these metals and bio-crystallization processes to remove and recover them from wastewaters.

This results in simple mathematical models to calculate reactor volumes and predict reactor performance. The second part of the course deals with equilibrium and mass transfer processes. Mass transfer equations combined with mass balances are used to model several processes, including multi-stage counter current gas washers, oxygen transfer in bio-reactors and solid waste treatment. The models are used to identify mass transfer limitations and to make designs of process equipment.</p>",

  "<p>Software plays an important role in many domains. Very often, scientists are writing or adapting computer programs to process or analyse their data and present their results in a suitable format (e.g. on the Internet). This course does not aim to produce professional programmers, but rather to build understanding of the underlying principles and equip future academics with basic skills to create computer programs for small-scale use. The same principles are needed for writing custom code in many simulation, modelling, and engineering tools.<br/>The programming language Python serves a broad application domain ranging from short scripts to full-blown software systems (e.g. Google uses Python). The course gives an introduction to libraries of available components, and how to use these for building your own software.<br/><br/></p><p>Note: The course in period five is only available for the February intake of MSc students from MBF and MPB. </p>",

  "Food fraud has been with us for millennia, but has become more advanced in the recent past. Originally adulteration of foods consisted of compositional fraud, i.e. dilution of products and admixture or replacement with lower value ingredients. Consumers are nowadays also interested in where there food comes from and how it has been produced, which add value to the product. This has aspect has led to a new kind of fraud, i.e. deception in regard to geographical and production system origin. Furthermore we have to consider fraud in view of processing and counterfeiting of high value products. Recent global food fraud scandals have further highlighted the need to strengthen companies' ability to mitigate against the risks of food fraud within their organizations and across their supply chain. Authorities, consumers and other stakeholders expect food companies to act proactively and mitigate against food fraud risks.<br>\r<br/>In this course, the student will learn about;<br>\r<br/>- definition and prevalence of food fraud as well as the legislation context;<br>\r<br/>- consumer and industry perceptions of food fraud;<br>\r<br/>- factors contributing to the fraud vulnerability of companies and chains, including criminological aspects;<br>\r<br/>- fraud vulnerability assessment strategies;<br>\r<br/>- soft and hard controls to reduce the vulnerability to fraud;<br>\r<br/>- basics of mass balance and practical examples;<br>\r<br/>- basics of analytical tests for fraud detection in and beyond the laboratory;<br>\r<br/>- food fraud mitigation in practice by guest speakers from industry, authorities, and retail.",

  "Food Logistics Management (FLM) is about how organisations fulfil market demand by getting the right food product, in the right quantity and quality, at the right time and place, as efficient and sustainable as possible. It discusses issues and developments in logistics theory (such as buffering, inventory management, risk pooling) and combines it with developments in food quality management (such as quality monitoring and control, product quality prediction models) and information technology. Together it provides a firm basis for research on Quality Controlled Logistics (QCL), i.e. using information on the dynamic product quality behaviour to control goods flows in the supply chain in order to optimize product availability at retail outlets in an efficient and sustainable way. Students will learn how to analyse, model and design innovative and sustainable logistics systems for agrifood products. Next to that, a web-based simulation game, called The Fresh Connection, is used in the course to give students the opportunity to experience in a virtual business environment what the effects are of logistic decision making in a food supply chain.",

  "<p>Managers and policy-makers dealing with uncertain market situations continuously face decisions of which the outcomes are uncertain. As collecting all information required to make an optimal decision is most of the times not possible, an understanding of the situation in terms of what the drivers are of the desired outcomes, why such drivers influence these outcomes and whether or not they will do so under all conditions, makes an important difference. In other words: conceptual thinking creates better decision-makers. The course creating frameworks for marketing and consumer behavior shows how marketing and consumer behavior specialists can find conceptual solutions to real-world problems. The course will help students to find the right approaches and logic when they should deal with their 'own' decisions in thesis research, internships and in the responsible positions they may hold later in their careers.

  "<p>The course food production chain deals with many steps that are necessary while going from agricultural raw materials to food products in the supermarket or other stores. The course includes aspects from processing, distribution, consumer purchase and consumer use.<br/>In the food production process steps are taken to extend the shelf life of food, to increase the variety in the diet and/or to provide the nutrients required for health. It is essential to understand the various steps during food processing. Usually these steps, or better called unit operations, are connected to each other and they have a specific and predictable effect on a food. A full understanding of food production chains requires insights in different disciplines, including a conceptual understanding of the chain and quantitative insight in its key processes. <br/>The application of mass and energy balances is a first step to obtain quantitative information on the process. In the food production chain, distribution of the food product or food logistic management plays an important role. It is essential that a product will be in the right quantity at the right place in the right time. Moreover, the ability to quantitatively describe and predict how quality attributes change along the food chain is essential to satisfy consumer's expectation and to optimize processes in each unit operation. Ultimately, food product chains are designed to deliver (superior) value to end consumers, who pay for the product in return. Consumers are therefore not only the 'end' of the chain, but in many ways also its 'beginning' . In the course we will learn how consumers make decisions for food products and what implications this has for the design and management of supply chains. <br/>Sustainable production of food is a big issue nowadays. For this reason attention will be paid to sustainability e.g. treatment of waste during food processing. Food production chains that will be discussed are production of chocolate, tea, soya, milk products, sugar etc.</p>",

  "Separating desired biological molecules from undesired by-products or feedstock residues is very important in the bioprocess industry and in biorefineries. It often requires separation of particles such as cells, organelles or product crystals from liquids, using sedimentation tanks, centrifuges or (membrane) filters. Separation of desired molecules from undesired ones is also frequently required, using for example extraction, adsorption, crystallization or evaporation. Finally it may be necessary to add or remove heat. This course teaches you how to design such separation units following either an equilibrium based approach or a transport rate-based approach; it extends the theory from BPE-12806 which uses only equilibria. You will learn how to derive the algebraic equations or ordinary differential equations needed for the unit design from force, mass and energy balances, and how to use them to calculate the required size, the allowed feeding rate or the possible product recovery efficiency of a separator. Attention is also paid to the design of simple process involving coupled process unit operation. <br/>This course is part of a series of process engineering courses, so skills and knowledge from BPE-12806 are required, as well as skills and knowledge from 1st-year mathematics and physical chemistry courses.<br/>Simple concepts of bioprocess engineering design are assumed to be known to set mass and energy balances and to evaluate the perfomance of unit operations.<br/>Knolwegde of methods for solving linear and non linear algebraical equation system as well as ordinary differential equation systems is mandatory.<br/>Knowledge of physics of fluid and granular solids are required.",

  "Please note: This course is exclusively intended for students of the History track in English and for exchange students. It is not necessary to indicate a preference for a seminar group; the degree programme will assign you to a seminar group.\n \nThis course will offer participants an overview of European history during the 'long nineteenth century', spanning the period from the French Revolution until the First World War. Students will start by examining how the legacy of the Revolution – universal citizenship and the Terror – and the reign of Napoleon manifested itself in the Restoration regimes. The course will also focus on the rise of modern political ideologies, such as nationalism, liberalism, conservatism and socialism. This will be followed by an exploration of the partly failed revolutions of 1848 and the national unifications of Germany and Italy. Participants will also study the politics and culture of the French and German Empires and the imperialist and colonial ambitions which had global repercussions in the late nineteenth century. Finally, an assessment will be made of the growing tensions contributing to the start of the First World War.",

  "Building on the foundations laid in BioNanoTechnology; an Introduction, this course will focus on applications of nanomaterials in medicinal applications. Nanomedicine is a most interdisciplinary field of research. In this course, focus is put on biomedical applications from in vitro and in vivo diagnostics, to in vivo multimodal diagnostic, therapeutic and theragnostic applications. Various types of solid and soft nanoparticle systems will be described, that act as host material or scaffolds used for biomedical applications. Solid particles comprise carbon-based material (e.g. fullerenes and carbonanotubes), metallic particles (Au, Ag), oxides (e.g. magnetic iron oxide, luminescent lanthanides) and semiconductor particles (quantum dots). Soft nanoparticle systems treated comprise nanometer-size well-defined polymers (dendrimers), aggregates (coordination polymers, vesicles, micelles) and virus particles. The (bio)chemical functionalization of particles´ inside and/or outside will be treated within the context of targeted nanomaterial/nanoparticles for biomedical and clinical use. In the practical course illustrative experiments are executed for preparation and characterization of nanomaterials, (bio)chemically functionalized solid & soft nanoparticles, coordination polymers and devices. Lectures on state-of-the-art use of nanomedicinal applications including demonstrations and hands-on practicals will be given during an excursion to the Interventional Molecular Imaging group at the Leiden University Medical Centre (LUMC). Reading and interpreting scientific literature in the field of nanomedicine will be integral part of the course.",

Je wordt door de opleiding in een werkgroep geplaatst.\nTijdens de vroegmoderne tijd, de periode van grofweg de late vijftiende tot de late achttiende eeuw, vonden in Europa ontwikkelingen plaats die het continent in de eeuwen daarna nog zouden beïnvloeden. Staten namen herkenbare vormen aan, kooplieden zochten naar nieuwe markten binnen en buiten Europa, en de Reformatie, de Wetenschappelijke Revolutie en de Verlichting resulteerden in nieuwe inzichten en wereldbeelden. De cursus Vroegmoderne Tijd richt zich op deze drie, vaak nauw met elkaar verbonden, themagebieden: staatsvorming, sociaaleconomische ontwikkelingen en culturele en religieuze ontwikkelingen. Wat was bijvoorbeeld het verband tussen nieuwe militaire technieken en staatsvorming? Waaruit bestond eigenlijk de impact van de Europese overzeese expansie? En hoe raakten de Reformatie en staatsvorming vervlochten? Naar het antwoord op deze en andere vragen gaan de studenten in de cursus Vroegmoderne Tijd op zoek.",

  "This course focuses on providing a general introduction into the mechanisms that determine the dynamics of the Earth system in the past, present and future, for example, the role of the biosphere in climate- and global change and, vice versa, the loss of biodiversity associated with climate- and global change. The course builds on integration of the disciplinary knowledge on Earth system processes such a hydrology, meteorology and biogeochemistry. It introduces the systems approach to study Earth system dynamics involving different temporal and spatial scales in process interactions and feedback mechanisms that explain observed climate- and global change. Emphasis is on Earth system interactions associated with dynamical, physical and biogeochemical processes affecting the state of the atmosphere, biosphere and hydrosphere under natural and anthropogenic conditions. The course's lectures are complemented with an intensive modelling activity, including the search for information on the Earth system and an introduction into the ethical and philosophical context of global and climate change issues.",
